      "text:  a suicide in texas there is a strange fiction that dominates american college campuses. it is the belief that america’s most “tolerant,” progressive, and sensitive communities are simultaneously virtual hellholes for marginalized members of the community, justifying emergency   measures designed to end oppression and defend the defenseless. thus, the federal government hypes false statistics that a staggering 20 percent of female students will be victims of sexual assault. thus, campuses implement disciplinary practices and policies that deny due process and treat straight men as guilty until proven innocent. and, colleges claim, it’s all necessary. after all, rape and sexual harassment represent   traumas. false accusations and unjust punishment? well, that’s just a momentary inconvenience  —   a small price to pay for the cause of social justice. \ttell that to the family of thomas klocke, a student at the university of texas at arlington. \tthe competing factual accounts are simple and difficult to resolve. a gay student accused klocke (who was straight) of typing “gays should die” into the search bar of his browser during a classroom conversation about privilege. when the gay student then typed into his own computer, “i’m gay. ” klocke then allegedly said that the gay student was a “faggot” and that he should consider killing himself. \tklocke’s account was diametrically opposed. he claimed that the gay student called him “beautiful. ” klocke then typed into his web browser, “stop, i’m straight. ” the gay student replied, “i’m gay” and then allegedly kept glancing at klocke, who eventually got up and moved seats. \tthe dean then allegedly assigned the case to the school’s associate director of academic integrity, who promptly issued an order prohibiting klocke not only from contacting his accuser, he also prohibited him from attending the class where the incident occurred, and  —   crucially  —   from contacting any member of the class, directly or through any other person. later, he reportedly barred klocke’s father, an attorney, from attending a meeting regarding the case, and then “decided” the dispute without following   procedures, without giving klocke the opportunity to contact or call witnesses, and indeed without hearing from any witness who could corroborate either student’s claims. the school, for its part, denies that it departed from mandatory processes and asserts that it “followed its policies and procedures. ” \tthe associate director of academic integrity found klocke responsible for “harassment,” placed him on probation for the remainder of his academic career at the university, and prohibited him from returning to the class where the incident occurred, though he could work on “group projects outside the classroom. ” \tparents of college boys sometimes take comfort that they can avoid the atmosphere of   hysteria by asking them to follow some relatively simple, commonsense guidelines. don’t drink too much. don’t engage the   culture. use basic manners so that coarse talk isn’t misconstrued. no advice is foolproof, of course, but following those three guidelines  —   in addition to being virtuous on their own merits  —   will help avoid a multitude of problems. \tnot for klocke, however. if his account is true (the university claims it followed proper procedures) then he was doing everything right. he was minding his own business in class, declined an unwelcome sexual advance, and changed seats. if his account is true, a gay student potentially motivated by embarrassment or fear was able to take advantage of the known bias of campus administrators to punish the man that he approached. \tthe lawsuit makes the interesting claim  —   one that rings true with my own experience  —   that universities have “sought prestige and publicity portraying themselves as leaders in curtailing sexual harassment, sexual violence, and aggressive behavior on campus. ” consequently, they “have a vested interest in enacting swift and harsh punishment (almost always upon males) who are merely accused of sexual harassment, sexual violence, or aggressive behavior, in order to preserve the appearance of their leadership. ” \tduring my own legal career, i’ve worked with students who’ve experienced many of the same things that thomas klocke’s family claims that he experienced. i’ve represented students whose parents were barred from disciplinary meetings, leaving them to face the wrath of administrators alone. i’ve seen students exploit existing relationships with administrators to achieve favorable outcomes in campus controversies. and i’ve also seen the speed and authority with which universities will respond to complaints by members of favored progressive victim groups. \tbut there’s something else i’ve seen. i’ve seen the cost imposed on students accused of misconduct  —   the fear and the stress as they feel like their reputations, their careers, and their dreams are vanishing before their very eyes. when they’re in the middle of the battle, and an entire school seems set against them, it can be hard to maintain perspective and to see through to the other side. \tsuicide is a complicated phenomenon, and i have no doubt that additional facts will emerge as the case works its way through the judicial system, but no one  —   ever  —   should believe that crackdowns come without cost or that due process is an abstract concept, a mere inconvenience that stands in the way of social justice. as i’ve argued before, our universities stand on the edge of a constitutional crisis. lawsuits are filling courtrooms from coast to coast, men and women face terrifying   witch hunts, and the ideological and financial incentives are pushing universities to shove aside students’ and professors’ unalienable rights to meet the impossible demands of unreasonable campus radicals. \tone doesn’t minimize sexual assault or sexual harassment by preserving due process. it is not a matter of either protecting the rights of the accuser or respecting the rights of the accused. instead, due process is a basic human right. failing to respect that right inflicts its own unique form of trauma on students, and sometimes that trauma can carry with it horrifying consequences.,\n",

      "text:  bullied 8-year-old’s death may not have been a suicide the death was startling even to the coroner: a boy only    apparently killing himself in his cincinnati bedroom. now gabriel taye’s january death is being   after it emerged that he was   at school two days before he died. hamilton county coroner lakshmi sammarco’s office has ruled gabriel’s death a suicide, but she said last week that she was reopening the investigation to   the boy’s injuries and whether there were contributing factors to his death. “it was very hard for me to believe that an    would even know what it means to commit suicide,” sammarco said. suicides are rare among children so young, but not unheard of. statistics from the u. s. centers for disease control and prevention show an average of 14 suicides per year nationwide among children 10 or younger since 1999. that compares to over 1, 400 per year among   to   . at 8, children generally are just coming to understand death, says dr. louis kraus, chief of child psychiatry at rush university medical center in chicago. conceiving of ending their own lives can be even more remote. “it’s possible, but at this young age, it’s very uncommon,” kraus said. even if a child has an idea of suicide, “many kids this young really don’t conceptualize the permanency of what they’re doing and what could happen. ” experts stress that at any age, suicide is a complex decision that often reflects a combination of life events and psychiatric problems, whether diagnosed or not. warning signs can be harder to read in young children than older people, said dr. alec miller, chief of child and adolescent psychology at albert einstein college of medicine in new york. but while kids might not have the vocabulary to discuss depression, it still might show up, perhaps as a change in behavior or complaints about aches or fatigue with no physical explanation, kraus notes. gabriel had no history of mental health issues, said carla leader, a lawyer for his mother, cornelia reynolds. people who knew him describe him as a    kid  —   “a very loving little boy who always had a smile on his face and would bring a smile to your face,” said carolyn emery, whose children went to school with him. gabriel was at school jan. 24 when, as seen on a choppy surveillance video the cincinnati public schools system released friday, he apparently tried to shake hands with a boy who had hit another child. attorneys for gabriel’s mother said the boy pushed gabriel into a wall, knocking him unconscious. an assistant principal arrived about 4 ½ minutes later to look at him. the school system said that it was “concerned about the length of time that (the boy) lay motionless and the lack of adult supervision at the scene” but that administrators followed protocol by having the nurse evaluate him. school officials said the boy told staff he had fainted and never said he had been bullied or assaulted. they said school administrators asked reynolds to get gabriel and take him to a hospital. but her attorneys say she decided on her own to pick him up and take him to the hospital after her sister, who was babysitting while reynolds was at work, called to say that gabriel had vomited and was complaining of stomach pains. doctors concluded he likely had a stomach virus and sent him home. two days later, gabriel hanged himself in his bedroom with a necktie, authorities said. according to her attorneys, reynolds didn’t learn of the schoolhouse confrontation until her attorneys got a copy of a police investigative file that described the surveillance video.\n",

      "text:  at penn state, critics claim, there’s no handle on hazing  (cnn) from the outside, penn state’s fraternities are a captivating sight. regal   mansions line a street aptly nicknamed ”frat row,” just south of a picturesque campus nestled in a valley. but when the mansion doors open, the allure subsides. the crown molding and grand staircases can’t hide the wear and tear of nights of parties. a glossy coat of spilled beer, mud and sweat often overtake the character of that old hardwood floor. some who have pledged allegiance inside these walls have horror stories. two lawsuits against penn state allege that university officials failed to respond appropriately to persistent problems with hazing and alcohol use at its fraternities. the plaintiffs claimed pledges were forced to drink excessive and dangerous amounts of alcohol. one alleges fraternity brothers burned pledges with hot wax, held a gun to their heads, and forced them to kill animals. and that a penn state employee    a resident assistant    knew about it, but didn’t report it. in one case, a member of the fraternity documented the hazing and reported it to the school, but he says he was ignored. it wasn’t until february of this year, after    beta theta pi pledge timothy piazza died, that penn state halted pledging and enacted restrictions on alcohol consumption and social functions within its greek community. and after details of piazza’s death emerged on friday from a   indictment against 18 fraternity members    including eight on charges of involuntary manslaughter    a grand jury has indicated it will take a look at the bigger picture: was penn state complicit in enabling a culture where there was no accountability? the grand jury report said conduct in a ”permissive atmosphere fostered by the pennsylvania state university interfraternity council” led to piazza’s death. it goes on to say that the ”grand jury has chosen to develop a full report concerning the conduct of the pennsylvania state university interfraternity council and, perhaps, the conduct of the university itself.” penn state is just now exiting the tunnel of one of the darkest university scandals in history    the conviction of assistant football coach jerry sandusky for molesting young boys for decades, and three school officials for failing to report his crimes. the news hit the university hard, and critics accused school administrators of having a culture of silence. penn state, after former president graham spanier was convicted of one misdemeanor charge, endangering the welfare of a child, in the sandusky case, said, ”. .. while we cannot undo the past, we have rededicated ourselves and our university to act always with the highest integrity, in affirming the shared values of our community.” less than two months later, penn state faces more allegations that administrators failed to protect young people in their charge    this time, inside the walls of its fraternities. efforts to speak with officials about   and   problems have been declined, but penn state provided written responses, saying in part, ”numerous recent reports demonstrate that regardless of size or location, hazing, binge drinking and related sexual assault issues are occurring throughout the country.” penn state says it has strong misconduct policy, at a press conference friday, university president eric barron called the grand jury’s findings ”heartwrenching and incomprehensible.” he said penn state ”has one of the most aggressive student misconduct policies in the country and its   policy pertaining to misconduct remains the most vigorous in the big 10.” ”it should not go without saying that hazing and dangerous drinking are not permitted by the university and the university takes appropriate actions to education students about these issues and hold them accountable whenever it learns of such wrongdoing,” barron said. ”all indicators suggest that beta theta pi was a model fraternity,” he said. ”it is clear, however, that this was no model fraternity.” according to beta theta pi international fraternity, its penn state chapter was previously disciplined twice. the first time, in 2009, the chapter was suspended for a year after it was found to be serving alcohol to minors. when it came back, it was a dry house. but in 2013, it was found in violation of the   housing policy put in place by the national chapter. penn state told cnn that the university is aware of 170 chapter conduct cases since the spring of 2015. ”wherever appropriate the university separately pursues student misconduct proceedings involving individuals.” according to the   interfraternity conference, penn state has used a private security company to assist in monitoring fraternity social activities for the past several years.  ’drinking until you were vomiting’ two years ago, in march 2015, barron promised to take a hard look at greek life at penn state. it came after   james vivenzio described hazing he says he endured at kappa delta rho fraternity. ”drinking until you were vomiting, they were shoving alcohol down your throat all the time,” vivenzio told cnn. pledges would have to stand around a trash can, he alleged, drink until they vomited, and then pass the bottle. later, he said, they’d have ”to do     in your own vomit.”  vivenzio describes being forced, along with his pledge class, to gather ingredients for, and then drink, a mixture of ”the most disgusting things you can think of.”  ”urine, vomit, and kind of anything they could find. just smelling it would make you throw up. it was pretty bad,” he said.  vivenzio says he reported being hazed to penn state twice before going to the police and filling a civil lawsuit. first, he says, he tried to report it anonymously in the fall of 2013 while he was still a pledge through the hotline that penn state told freshmen about during their orientation. no changes were made, he said, so vivenzio began to document everything he could: alleged beatings, a private facebook page, the text messages to pledges that read, ”destroying ur lives, dignity and removing ur   souls.”  vivenzio says, after three months, he decided he could no longer take it. he left school, went back to his parents’ home in virginia and called penn state to report what he had documented. the director of the office of student conduct, danny shaha, drove from state college, penn state’s main campus, to the vivenzio home. with his parents, vivenzio sat at the kitchen table and handed shaha a stack of documents.  ”and we showed him all this and i pledged my help. i was like ’i want this to change,’” vivenzio said.  vivenzio says he heard nothing from penn state for a nearly a year.  in the meantime, because the fraternity hadn’t removed vivenzio from a private facebook group or the group text messages, vivenzio said he could see that hazing continued. vivenzio said it was not uncommon to see pledges talking about being ”forcefed liquor.” or messages like ”let’s haze.” it wasn’t until the student called police in 2015, and a private kappa delta rho facebook page made national news    because it contained pictures of seemingly unconscious naked women    that penn state investigated and found evidence of hazing, including underage drinking. police told cnn their investigation closed when, in may 2015, penn state banned the fraternity from its campus for three years and kappa delta rho expelled 38 of its members from the fraternity. penn state officials wouldn’t agree to an interview, but in a statement to cnn the university disputed vivenzio’s version of the story. penn state said it offered vivenzio ”extraordinary assistance ” but ultimately, ”neither he nor his family were willing to file a complaint, provide documentation, speak with state college police or participate in pursuing the formal disciplinary process.” vivenzio and both of his parents insist to cnn that they did everything they could to work with police and school authorities.  no consensus among task force members, after closing kappa delta rho’s chapter, barron announced the formation of a   task force, made up of community and university leaders. ”overall, we clearly knew that we could not . .. things could not stay the same,” said ron binder, associate dean of student affairs at the university of   who chaired one of the task force’s subcommittees and who used to be the national president for the association of   advisors. ”the committee worked pretty hard, close to a year and a half. i thought we came up with some good recommendations.” however, binder and another task force member, state college borough manager thomas fountaine, said there were a number of dissenting reports. at times, they said, there were strong and competing opinions that couldn’t be reconciled into a consensus. still, the subcommittees turned in their reports to penn state, but a final report was never made public. penn state says it felt that members of that task force couldn’t come to a consensus in areas that were ”critical to effect substantial change.” ”these issues are made more complicated by the fact that these organizations are largely   and operate independently. they are private organizations on private property. so meaningful change requires the   and deep involvement of the undergraduate active members,” a university spokesperson said. penn state enacted many of the task force’s recommendations after piazza died, according to binder. national greek group: ’we have known about concerns’ penn state has one of the largest greek communities in the nation. with 8, 000 students members of fraternity and sorority life, greek life is woven into the fabric of the nittany lion experience.  the universities largest    and most public    annual fundraiser, a dance marathon to raise money for its own cancer research fund, is largely propped up by greek life participants. but for two and a half years, penn state has not had a   director of greek life organizations, says jud horras, president of the   interfraternity conference.  ”in the absence of that, these alumni, students, university and national organizations, have a hard time working together,” says horras. penn state disputes this, saying ”the university has never been without a director of fraternity and sorority life,” adding that the danny shaha took over the interim position. horras has been critical of both the student leadership at penn state, and how the administration has dealt with student greek leaders. ”we have known about concerns and challenges there for quite some time. they’ve had alcohol concerns, hazing concerns, drug abuse. there have been a lot of concerns at penn state,” says horras, who is meeting with barron next month. ”the challenge is that the solution lies in getting the students to take ownership of the community and govern more effectively. they have to have ownership in the expectations set and their willingness to govern each other.” after piazza’s death, the university’s interfraternity council got into a open letter war with barron, exchanging blame for fraternity misconduct. horras said that, since then, he’s been encouraged by penn state student leaders who he says are ready to take on these problems, and said he sees ”signs that more collaboration between the administration, students, and alumni is starting to happen.” the circumstances of piazza’s death were shocking. he was allegedly forced to drink so much alcohol that his blood alcohol level was estimated to be about four times the legal limit in pennsylvania. the grand jury report says piazza was intoxicated when he fell down a flight of stairs, and that he proceeded to fall multiple times, repeatedly hitting his head, after fraternity brothers tried to revive him. the grand jury also found, as fellow brothers stepped over him, others googled remedies for his ”cold hands” and ”cold feet.” but no one called police for 12 hours. a grand jury on friday recommended 18 members of the fraternity be charged criminally    eight face involuntary manslaughter cases. the fraternity’s chapter president alone faces 200 counts related to hazing, aggravated assault, involuntary manslaughter and reckless endangerment.  ”the larger problem at penn state has been an institutional and culture void, and a culture of excessiveness and permissiveness to which penn state and any number of fraternities have turned a blind eye,” said piazza family attorney tom kline. ”. ..this death wasn’t an accident it was an inevitability based on everything that the grand jury said.” the governing body of beta theta pi international fraternity, where piazza pledged, issued a statement after charges against some of its members were announced. in part, it said, ”the early findings of that investigation indicated that the behavior of several undergraduate members was in direct contradiction of the international fraternity’s expectations and risk management policies, as well as the international fraternity’s reputation and commitment to character development. beta theta pi international fraternity has clearly and consistently expressed its position that it does not tolerate hazing or alcohol abuse in any form by its members. the former undergraduate members were well ecducated by the international fraternity and penn state on these policies however, they are entitled to the presumption of innocence as they face these charges.” cnn has been unable to reach beta theta pi’s local chapter president, or his lawyer, for comment.   one student jumped to his death, in the spring of 2014, about the same time that vivenzio officially reported hazing to penn state, another penn state family was dealing with a much more devastating tragedy. marquise braham, who was at penn state altoona on an academic scholarship, jumped from the roof of an   building on long island. it was the day before he was to return from spring break to his fraternity phi sigma kappa. braham had gone through brutal hazing during his fall semester as a pledge, according to his family’s lawsuit.  the suit, filed in december 2015, lays it out in detail: being forced to choose between snorting cocaine or being sodomized stealing gutting, skinning and killing animals forced physical fighting that resulted in concussions extreme sleep deprivation guns pointed at their heads hot wax dripped down their backs enormous consumption of alcohol. braham had befriended a fellow student, a female resident assistant who was supposed to be trained in recognizing and reporting school policy violations. in text messages made part of the lawsuit, she encouraged him to stick it out. ”i feel like i’ve done so much that it can’t get any worse but it always does lol,” braham wrote to her.  braham returned to penn state the next semester as a brother. the lawsuit claims he continued to struggle, forced to haze a new class of pledges. ”i’m just hanging in here haha. hazing season just started so i’m kinda glad to go back home. some of this shit is just hard to watch when you’re a brother,” he texted to her on march 5, 2014, according to the lawsuit. the next day, he continued, ”i just never thought i would get to the point where i needed counseling. that just isn’t me [you know] sometimes i just feel like i’m falling apart . ..” she responded: ”i am worried about you. i didn’t know it was this bad.” and later, ”i’m worried as f**k about you. ’” on march 7, 2014, the resident assistant and another penn state employee reported to their supervisor that they believed braham was in a state of dangerous psychological crisis, the lawsuit says.  ”but no action was taken to intervene, get marquise immediate help, or inform marquise’s parents of his psychological crisis, despite marquise having signed a waiver allowing penn state to communicate directly with his parents regarding his academic and health issues,” the family’s lawsuit says. the same day the resident assistant notified penn state officials of braham’s state of mind, braham, a devout catholic, returned home to uniondale and told his aunt that he needed to ”confess his fraternity ’sins,’” the lawsuit says.  he jumped to his death one week later. when his devastated parents asked penn state officials whether there were any warning signs    of why their seemingly happy and healthy son who was eager to help others and excited to pursue a career in physical therapy would kill himself at 18    penn state officials said nothing, the family attorney said.  ”penn state kept this information secret from the family, leaving them in the dark and exacerbating their suffering ever since his death,” the lawsuit says.  when the hazing became public, through a police investigation, penn state investigated, and revoked the phi sigma kappa’s license to operate on the campus for six years. phi sigma kappa members denied the hazing claims. in january 2016, the state attorney general’s office announced that a grand jury had investigated the case and returned no criminal charges. while the panel said there was evidence of   hazing that was ”extremely dangerous and put the health and safety of all pledges at risk,” it said there was nothing to connect braham’s suicide to his being hazed.   ”rather the evidence points to a young man who, though he had a sunny and very pleasant exterior, had been contemplating suicide for a very long time,” the grand jury said. ”(this) investigation and this report should shine a light on what can happen to vulnerable    when they go off to college.” penn state campus police say they will notify families of student emergencies, including times when they ”experience other personal emergencies.”     a penn state spokesman told cnn the university cannot comment on legal matters, but said the policy related to emergencies takes student privacy into account. ”we balance the critical   of the situation with the student’s privacy rights as we make the decision to contact parents, or not.” braham’s civil lawsuit is still being litigated and penn state has made a motion to have the case dismissed. penn state said that after his death, ”processes and practices for fraternity and sorority life on campuses were reviewed.” ’i saw something coming’  there is no national database of   deaths and incidents, so it’s hard to know how widespread the problems like those at penn state are.  horras, the   interfraternity conference president, said he is working with a new company to begin tracking fraternity misconduct across the country. federal privacy laws often get in the way of transparency, horras said.  vivenzio claims penn state’s representation of greek life is deceptive. he is suing the university for alleged fraud. the website says there are many myths about greek communities, but ”the reality is that men and women in fraternities and sororities are committed to their academics, volunteer their time in the community, develop and strengthen their leadership skills. ..” a qa on hazing says the school has a   policy.   ”those statements were knowingly false,” said vivenzio’s attorney, aaron freiwald. ”james and others relied on those statements to his detriment. penn state knew hazing was taking place and took a ’well, that’s what goes on here’ kind of attitude, so when they said there was zero tolerance for hazing, that was a false statement and (vivenzio) says he wouldn’t have rushed if he’d known about hazing.”  braham family attorney doug fierberg has sued over this issue in the past and won against several universities, forcing them to post all of their incidents online. other schools have followed voluntarily. penn state is not among them. penn state would not make any of its officials available for an interview with cnn, either before or after piazza’s death. it did respond in writing about the vivenzio and braham lawsuits, saying that ”after both instances of fraternity misconduct were reported to the university, penn state took the strongest action available. in addition to student misconduct proceedings, it withdrew recognition of the fraternities involved    which in essence shuts them down.” when vivenzio heard about piazza’s death, he said he broke down and cried.

      "it goes on to say that the ”grand jury has chosen to develop a full report concerning the conduct of the pennsylvania state university interfraternity council and, perhaps, the conduct of the university itself.” penn state is just now exiting the tunnel of one of the darkest university scandals in history    the conviction of assistant football coach jerry sandusky for molesting young boys for decades, and three school officials for failing to report his crimes\n",

      "first, he says, he tried to report it anonymously in the fall of 2013 while he was still a pledge through the hotline that penn state told freshmen about during their orientation\n",
      "no changes were made, he said, so vivenzio began to document everything he could: alleged beatings, a private facebook page, the text messages to pledges that read, ”destroying ur lives, dignity and removing ur   souls.”  vivenzio says, after three months, he decided he could no longer take it\n",
      "he left school, went back to his parents’ home in virginia and called penn state to report what he had documented\n",

      " in the meantime, because the fraternity hadn’t removed vivenzio from a private facebook group or the group text messages, vivenzio said he could see that hazing continued\n",
      "vivenzio said it was not uncommon to see pledges talking about being ”forcefed liquor.” or messages like ”let’s haze.” it wasn’t until the student called police in 2015, and a private kappa delta rho facebook page made national news    because it contained pictures of seemingly unconscious naked women    that penn state investigated and found evidence of hazing, including underage drinking\n",
      "police told cnn their investigation closed when, in may 2015, penn state banned the fraternity from its campus for three years and kappa delta rho expelled 38 of its members from the fraternity\n",
      "penn state officials wouldn’t agree to an interview, but in a statement to cnn the university disputed vivenzio’s version of the story\n",
      "penn state said it offered vivenzio ”extraordinary assistance ” but ultimately, ”neither he nor his family were willing to file a complaint, provide documentation, speak with state college police or participate in pursuing the formal disciplinary process.” vivenzio and both of his parents insist to cnn that they did everything they could to work with police and school authorities\n",

      "at times, they said, there were strong and competing opinions that couldn’t be reconciled into a consensus\n",
      "still, the subcommittees turned in their reports to penn state, but a final report was never made public\n",
      "penn state says it felt that members of that task force couldn’t come to a consensus in areas that were ”critical to effect substantial change.” ”these issues are made more complicated by the fact that these organizations are largely   and operate independently\n",

      "”the challenge is that the solution lies in getting the students to take ownership of the community and govern more effectively\n",
      "they have to have ownership in the expectations set and their willingness to govern each other.” after piazza’s death, the university’s interfraternity council got into a open letter war with barron, exchanging blame for fraternity misconduct\n",
      "horras said that, since then, he’s been encouraged by penn state student leaders who he says are ready to take on these problems, and said he sees ”signs that more collaboration between the administration, students, and alumni is starting to happen.” the circumstances of piazza’s death were shocking\n",
      "he was allegedly forced to drink so much alcohol that his blood alcohol level was estimated to be about four times the legal limit in pennsylvania\n",

      "text:  son of french connection drug ring mastermind jailed for trafficking cocaine the son of one of the men behind the world’s most prolific heroin smuggling ring, dubbed the “french connection” has been jailed for six years for trafficking cocaine. didier filippi, 54, was found guilty on tuesday of trafficking cocaine between marseille and the french riviera. his father homere filippi was the mastermind behind a gang that shipped vast quantities of heroin from turkey to the united states via france and canada in the 1960s and 1970s. he disappeared without a trace following the 1981 murder of french judge pierre michel for which he was convicted of ordering and subsequently sentenced in absentia to life imprisonment in 1988.  his son was found to have sold 11kg (24lb) of cocaine between september 2013 and march 2015. several other defendants in the case, heard at a court in draguignan,   france, were sentenced to between 30 months and six years for their involvement in the drug ring. mathieu   the son of another french connection mastermind  —   gaetan zampa  —   was also accused in the case but killed himself before the verdicts could be delivered. prosecutors said that the case against the defendants could have been titled “the children of the french connection”. they added that the “very well organised network” had generated profits of more than €100, 000 ($110, 000) in just two years. the investigation began in september 2013 following the discovery of three packets of white powder in a vehicle belonging to filippi during a customs check.  france’s role in the international heroin trade was famously portrayed in the 1971 film “the french connection”.  in 1972, french customs police in marseille seized 425kg of heroin as part of an operation that broke up the network.\n",

      "text:   underage sex scandal rocks police departments in northern california  a sex scandal involving a teenage prostitute and more than two dozen police officers has shaken several law enforcement agencies in northern california, prompting multiple investigations and the resignation of a major city police chief. the woman, now 18, alleges she was involved with at least 31 officers from across the bay area, accepting money in exchange for sex and, at times, tips on when and where police would be cracking down on prostitution. some of the encounters, she said, happened when she was a minor. “be safe today!! want some advice?” one officer texted her before warning about an undercover sting. “thank you daddy,” she texted back, according to messages she provided to local media. “i appreciate it ion wanna go to jail lol. ” the allegations have implicated officers in seven separate police departments, including the oakland police department, where five officers were placed on administrative leave during an internal investigation. two of those officers have since resigned. a deputy with the contra costa county sheriff’s department and an inspector with the alameda county district attorney’s office have been placed on administrative leave in connection with the allegations, officials told buzzfeed news. but the allegations that police officers had been involved with the young sex worker exploded into a   scandal when one of the officers, accused of having sex with her when she was 17, killed himself last year. a suicide note left behind by the oakland police officer reportedly revealed his relationship with the teen and named four other uniformed officers who had some sort of contact with her as well, touching off an internal investigation that would eventually expand to several other law enforcement agencies. according to the teen, who goes by the name “celeste guap” on social media, she had sexual relationships with 14 oakland police officers  —   including three while she was a minor  —   five richmond police officers, three san francisco police officers, one stockton police officer, one livermore police officer, four alameda county deputies, and three contra costa county deputies. “we are dealing with disgusting allegations that disturb me greatly,” oakland mayor libby schaaf said at a press conference wednesday. “the culture of this department does not tolerate unethical behavior, sexual misconduct, or lying. ” not only are departments looking into allegations that their officers became involved with a teen who has described herself as a prostitute, but officials are also looking into the possibility officers might have had sex with her while she was a minor. the shocking allegations were first reported by the east bay express earlier this month, which detailed how guap became involved with oakland police officer brendan o’brien in february 2015 while running away from a pimp. guap was a minor at the time. when the two ran into each other again weeks later, she told the paper they began to flirt and soon after were dating and having sex. guap has told reporters, however, that she became involved with other police officers as well, partly to avoid going to jail. law enforcement officials told buzzfeed news that guap was personally connected with police departments in the bay area. her mother is a dispatcher for the oakland police department. her stepfather also works as a dispatcher, although it was not immediately clear for what agency. according to the east bay express, the teen eventually told an oakland policesergeant days before o’brien’s death that she had been seeing the officer despite being underage. the department had been looking into the allegations, but the young officer left a suicide note behind talking about his contact with guap and named four other officers who may also have had a sexual relationship with the girl, the east bay express and san jose mercury news reported. “the only officer i ever messed with underage is sadly gone now,” guap wrote last month on facebook. “so i don’t know why this is still being brought up. ” the suicide and resulting scandal prompted two oakland police investigations and led to the abrupt resignation last week of police chief sean whent. oakland mayor libby schaaf said the chief, who was hired to help reform the troubled department, was stepping down due to “personal reasons. ” but local media reported whent was actually forced out of his position as a result of his handling of the growing scandal, and allegations that some of the officers involved with guap had given her advance notice of undercover prostitution stings. the oakland police department has been under federal oversight due to misconduct since 2003, and the department’s independent police monitor reportedly became aware of the allegations in march. whent was replaced by interim police chief ben fairow, but, in a bizarre twist, fairow was suddenly removed from the position on wednesday, just six days after he had been appointed to the job. schaaf said at a press conference she had asked fairow to step down after “information that i received monday raised concerns for me about whether he can effectively lead this department at this particular moment in time and in this critical transition. ” bay area rapid transit police chief kenton rainey later said fairow resigned because, “while he was married, he had a personal relationship with a consenting adult more than a decade ago. ” fairow has since been reassigned to his old position as deputy chief of the department’s support services division. along with the multiple internal investigations being conducted at the law enforcement agencies, buzzfeed news has learned district attorneys in alameda and contra costa counties are also conducting separate investigations into the allegations against deputies in their counties and officers from the oakland, richmond, san francisco, stockton, and livermore police departments. so far, no criminal charges have been filed. “while it is our practice not to discuss pending investigations, i can firmly state that we do not and will not turn a blind eye to human trafficking or the sexual exploitation of a minor, whether the offender is a civilian or a law enforcement officer,” alameda county district attorney nancy o’malley said in a statement. “we take the allegation seriously and will not tolerate this alleged conduct by our employee, as we uphold the highest ethical standards,” sgt. jimmy lee of the contra costa county sheriff’s department told buzzfeed news. the san francisco police department is also conducting an internal investigation. “we are aware of the investigation and are conducting a review to determine if any of our members had any inappropriate contact with the victim,” san francisco police officer carlos manfredi said. alameda county sheriff officials said their deputies were determined to have not conducted any illegal or unethical behavior, although they were found to have had contact with the sex worker. “we have no reason to believe that they did anything illegal or unethical in their contacts with ms. guap,” sgt. ray kelly of the alameda county sheriff’s department told buzzfeed news. the investigation determined that guap was 18 when she was had contact with the alameda deputies, and that there was no indication that money was exchanged for sex, kelly said. stockton police officials also said their officer had been cleared of wrongdoing. kelly said that the deputies and guap met each other through facebook, and that they did not know she was a sex worker at the time. they were also unaware of her involvement with other officers, or deputies in their own agency. exactly what kind of contact she had with officers in multiple agencies will be reviewed by the multiple investigations. on her facebook account, guap often posted pictures of herself with uniformed police officers. and on tuesday, she said she had recently been questioned by investigators for more than 12 hours about her contact with police officers in the area. guap did not return multiple requests for comment from buzzfeed news. in addition to the multiple internal investigations and reviews by two district attorney offices, law enforcement sources said federal officials are reviewing the allegations. spokespersons for the fbi and department of justice told buzzfeed news they could not confirm or deny the existence of any ongoing investigations. the california attorney general’s office also said state officials are monitoringthe ongoing investigations. “the allegations of misconduct, if true, are disturbing and reflect a serious breach of the trust placed in law enforcement by the communities we are sworn to serve,” a spokesperson said. “there must be swift accountability for any wrongdoing. ”  \n",

      "text:  a suicide in texas there is a strange fiction that dominates american college campuses. it is the belief that america’s most “tolerant,” progressive, and sensitive communities are simultaneously virtual hellholes for marginalized members of the community, justifying emergency   measures designed to end oppression and defend the defenseless. thus, the federal government hypes false statistics that a staggering 20 percent of female students will be victims of sexual assault. thus, campuses implement disciplinary practices and policies that deny due process and treat straight men as guilty until proven innocent. and, colleges claim, it’s all necessary. after all, rape and sexual harassment represent   traumas. false accusations and unjust punishment? well, that’s just a momentary inconvenience  —   a small price to pay for the cause of social justice. \ttell that to the family of thomas klocke, a student at the university of texas at arlington. \tthe competing factual accounts are simple and difficult to resolve. a gay student accused klocke (who was straight) of typing “gays should die” into the search bar of his browser during a classroom conversation about privilege. when the gay student then typed into his own computer, “i’m gay. ” klocke then allegedly said that the gay student was a “faggot” and that he should consider killing himself. \tklocke’s account was diametrically opposed. he claimed that the gay student called him “beautiful. ” klocke then typed into his web browser, “stop, i’m straight. ” the gay student replied, “i’m gay” and then allegedly kept glancing at klocke, who eventually got up and moved seats. \tthe dean then allegedly assigned the case to the school’s associate director of academic integrity, who promptly issued an order prohibiting klocke not only from contacting his accuser, he also prohibited him from attending the class where the incident occurred, and  —   crucially  —   from contacting any member of the class, directly or through any other person. later, he reportedly barred klocke’s father, an attorney, from attending a meeting regarding the case, and then “decided” the dispute without following   procedures, without giving klocke the opportunity to contact or call witnesses, and indeed without hearing from any witness who could corroborate either student’s claims. the school, for its part, denies that it departed from mandatory processes and asserts that it “followed its policies and procedures. ” \tthe associate director of academic integrity found klocke responsible for “harassment,” placed him on probation for the remainder of his academic career at the university, and prohibited him from returning to the class where the incident occurred, though he could work on “group projects outside the classroom. ” \tparents of college boys sometimes take comfort that they can avoid the atmosphere of   hysteria by asking them to follow some relatively simple, commonsense guidelines. don’t drink too much. don’t engage the   culture. use basic manners so that coarse talk isn’t misconstrued. no advice is foolproof, of course, but following those three guidelines  —   in addition to being virtuous on their own merits  —   will help avoid a multitude of problems. \tnot for klocke, however. if his account is true (the university claims it followed proper procedures) then he was doing everything right. he was minding his own business in class, declined an unwelcome sexual advance, and changed seats. if his account is true, a gay student potentially motivated by embarrassment or fear was able to take advantage of the known bias of campus administrators to punish the man that he approached. \tthe lawsuit makes the interesting claim  —   one that rings true with my own experience  —   that universities have “sought prestige and publicity portraying themselves as leaders in curtailing sexual harassment, sexual violence, and aggressive behavior on campus. ” consequently, they “have a vested interest in enacting swift and harsh punishment (almost always upon males) who are merely accused of sexual harassment, sexual violence, or aggressive behavior, in order to preserve the appearance of their leadership. ” \tduring my own legal career, i’ve worked with students who’ve experienced many of the same things that thomas klocke’s family claims that he experienced. i’ve represented students whose parents were barred from disciplinary meetings, leaving them to face the wrath of administrators alone. i’ve seen students exploit existing relationships with administrators to achieve favorable outcomes in campus controversies. and i’ve also seen the speed and authority with which universities will respond to complaints by members of favored progressive victim groups. \tbut there’s something else i’ve seen. i’ve seen the cost imposed on students accused of misconduct  —   the fear and the stress as they feel like their reputations, their careers, and their dreams are vanishing before their very eyes. when they’re in the middle of the battle, and an entire school seems set against them, it can be hard to maintain perspective and to see through to the other side. \tsuicide is a complicated phenomenon, and i have no doubt that additional facts will emerge as the case works its way through the judicial system, but no one  —   ever  —   should believe that crackdowns come without cost or that due process is an abstract concept, a mere inconvenience that stands in the way of social justice. as i’ve argued before, our universities stand on the edge of a constitutional crisis. lawsuits are filling courtrooms from coast to coast, men and women face terrifying   witch hunts, and the ideological and financial incentives are pushing universities to shove aside students’ and professors’ unalienable rights to meet the impossible demands of unreasonable campus radicals. \tone doesn’t minimize sexual assault or sexual harassment by preserving due process. it is not a matter of either protecting the rights of the accuser or respecting the rights of the accused. instead, due process is a basic human right. failing to respect that right inflicts its own unique form of trauma on students, and sometimes that trauma can carry with it horrifying consequences.,\n",

      "text:  4 nypd officials busted in de blasio fundraising probe four nypd officials  —   including three   cops  —   have been busted as part of the sweeping federal corruption probe rocking the police department and mayor bill de blasio’s office, federal prosecutors announced monday. “it is a heartbreaking thing,” manhattan us attorney preet bharara said. “an officer who betrays his badge betrays every honorable officer. ” deputy chief michael harrington, deputy inspector james grant and sgt. david villanueva were arrested at their homes at 6 a. m. monday by fbi agents and hauled into 26 federal plaza in lower manhattan, sources said. officer richard ochetal has already pleaded guilty to accepting bribes in exchange for expediting gun permit applications, prosecutors revealed. the arrests mark the first time nypd officers have been charged in the   probe, which has focused on lavish gifts and vacations that cops allegedly accepted in exchange for official services, such as security details and police escorts. de blasio’s buddy jeremy reichberg  —   a brooklyn businessman known for his nypd connections  —   was also arrested monday by federal agents and nypd internal affairs officers, who have assisted in the sprawling investigation. “the alleged conduct violates the basic principle that public servants are to serve the public, not help themselves to cash and benefits just for doing their jobs,” bharara said. under the federal indictment unsealed by bharara, grant, harrington and reichberg were all charged with one count of conspiracy to commit honest services wire fraud. each faces a maximum of 20 years in prison if convicted. ochetal has already pleaded guilty to one count of bribery and faces up to 10 years in prison. villanueva faces up to 15 years in prison on bribery and conspiracy charges. both formerly worked in the nypd’s gun licensing unit and were accused of selling firearm licenses in exchange for bribes. from 2011 to 2015, reichberg and his business associate, jona rechnitz, referred to as “ ” in the indictment, “cultivated close relationships with numerous members of the nypd,” including grant and harrington, the documents state. reichberg and rechnitz shelled out large sums of cash to pay for “personal and financial benefits for grant, harrington and others, including paying for flights, hotel rooms, prostitutes, expensive meals, home improvements and prime seats at sporting events, among other things,” the indictment says. in january 2013, reichberg coughed up more than $59, 000 for an    trip for grant, his detective friend and two other people to fly on a private jet to the super bowl  —   complete with their own personal prostitute, the documents say. the hooker stayed in grant’s room at a trendy vegas hotel, but others also “took advantage of her services during the trip,” the papers say. several months later, in august, reichberg paid for a   stay for grant and his family at a posh hotel in rome, italy, that was personally recommended by the shady businessman, the indictment says. reichberg also allegedly paid to refurbish grant’s staten island house by replacing the outside railings at an estimated cost of $6, 000  —   and he even found the contractors to do the job, the indictment says. on christmas day 2013, reichberg and rechnitz put on little elf hats and drove to grant’s home to deliver gifts, including a video game system for his kids and a $1, 000 piece of jewelry for his wife, the papers state. the two businessmen then made a similar delivery of gifts at harrington’s house. grant later complained that “his two elves” did not return the following christmas, according to the documents. in exchange for the gifts, grant allegedly provided reichberg and rechnitz with police escorts to and from the airport, utilizing the lights and sirens of police cars, the paper say. on several occasions, grant allegedly dispatched cops to two of rechnitz’s buildings to investigate a trespasser and a theft. he also personally escorted rechnitz and his buddies beyond police barricades to prime locations at parades, the new york city marathon and the new year’s eve celebration in times square, the documents say. “they got in effect a private police force for themselves and their friends,” bharara said. harrington, the executive officer for former chief of department phil banks, received similar gifts in exchange for favors. from may 2013 to november 2014, rechnitz took harrington and banks out to expensive manhattan restaurants at least once or twice a week and they ran up bills in excess of $400, the papers say. rechnitz and reichberg also allegedly supplied harrington with numerous tickets to numerous sporting events, including a pair of brooklyn nets tickets valued at $400 a pop. they also gave him two new york rangers tickets totaling $1, 400, the indictment says. harrington, in return for the gifts, provided reichberg with tens of thousands of dollars of business for a private security firm partly run by harrington’s family. reichberg obtained work for the security firm at a manhattan school affiliated with rechnitz, the papers say  —   the company was paid about $5, 000 a month for a period of 15 months until the spring of 2016. at reichberg’s request, harrington also allegedly had an   nypd officer disciplined because the cop was working security for a jewelry business competing with reichberg’s jewelry store. harrington, through his family’s security firm, also agreed to facilitate an arrest for reichberg of a suspected criminal, the papers state. bharara said the investigation is still ongoing. “i don’t know whether you should expect more [arrests] or not,” he added. several more current and former police officials are still being investigated, including banks, who, along with his best friend and former correction union boss norman seabrook, allegedly took a freebie vacation with rechnitz and other nypd cops. seabrook was recently arrested on corruption charges and pleaded not guilty. many nypd officers have retired or have been placed on modified duty since the start of the criminal probe. one officer, michael milici, was fired for refusing to cooperate with the feds and another, inspector michael ameri, fatally shot himself after being grilled by fbi investigators. the feds are also probing the mayor’s fundraising practices and some of his closest confidants in an effort to find out if favors, contracts or positions were offered for campaign donations. grant’s lawyer, john meringolo, said, “we’re going to evaluate all the evidence. at this point, we believe mr. grant did not commit a federal crime. ” harrington’s attorney, andrew weinstein, said the charges were “politically motivated. ” “chief harrington is a loyal and devoted family man who has an unblemished record and has spent the past three decades working tirelessly to keep new york city safe,” he said. “one would be hard pressed to find a straighter arrow. ” reichberg’s lawyer also insisted he “did not commit a crime. ” “his only mistake was his friendship with jona rechnitz, a criminal who has admitted bribing a union official and who is desperately trying to get others in trouble in order to curry favor with prosecutors and save his own skin,” attorney susan necheles said.\n",

      "text:  autism’s placebo problem what started as a seed of doubt in leigh merryday porch’s mind had, by 2010, become a conviction. her    son, callum, was delayed in his speech and motor skills. his hearing was perfect, but he often didn’t respond when spoken to. merryday porch’s family has a history of autism, and she finally realized that her son, too, has the condition. not one to sit on her hands, she simultaneously enrolled callum in florida’s   process, found a developmental pediatrician and, as so many parents do, began looking into alternative therapies. a school librarian, she soon happened across a book on autism that mentioned the controversial florida doctor jeff bradstreet. bradstreet was a vocal critic of vaccines and a proponent of unproven alternative autism treatments such as chelation therapy. merryday porch was aware that many people said bradstreet’s remedies were nothing but placebos —  inert substances that provide temporary relief (or seem to) only because people hope they will. she freely admits she was never terribly interested in science (she majored in english in college) and that she might not have been skeptical enough. but bradstreet’s theories and treatments seemed above board. “you go to these websites and they look very   and very authentic,” she says. “i wouldn’t say i was convinced this was the answer, but i didn’t want to regret not looking into it. ” she wanted to offer her son every chance to thrive. because bradstreet’s clinic was only a couple of hours’ drive away, she took callum to see him. bradstreet espoused the theory that autism is linked to high levels of mercury —  an idea that has been discredited but led to widespread mistrust of vaccines. he also said autism is related to immune function, an unproven theory that he told merryday porch might explain callum’s case. he put callum through a series of unusual tests —  assays for fecal parasites, tests that purportedly measured free radicals in his blood (available only by sending samples to france) and many assessing callum’s immune system —  none of which turned up anything. still, he prescribed a strict   diet and a host of supplements, including cod liver oil. for six months, merryday porch went along with the therapies. unlike many of bradstreet’s clients, she wasn’t trying to “cure” callum’s autism, but rather improve a few of his symptoms, such as his lack of language skills. and at first, she was thrilled with the regimen. after taking cod liver oil, callum, who rarely spoke, began happily naming characters he saw on television. her expectation —  her profound hope —  that the treatment might work was buoyed. but even as her child seemed to be getting better, residual skepticism kept her from trying more involved, potentially harmful treatments. doubts festered in her mind, aggravated by the fact that the same doctor prescribing the supplements was also selling them. one day during an appointment, when merryday porch had to force her panicked son down on a table for yet another blood draw, she finally snapped. “every instinct in me just told me: ‘just get out of here and don’t come back,’” she says. so that’s what she did, giving up the pills and the diets for scientifically accepted treatments such as speech therapy. bradstreet was eventually forced to leave florida and then investigated by the u. s. food and drug administration (fda) for selling fraudulent autism therapies, in particular, one treatment —  globulin component   factor —  related to the tests he ordered for callum. soon after, he apparently took his own life. today, merryday porch says bradstreet’s therapies were a waste of time and money, and that all callum’s gains during that time were either in her imagination or the natural course of his development. if anything, she says, the treatments may have been detrimental. she is grateful she never went in for alternative therapies with strong side effects, although she says callum —  now 7 years old and a happy child —  has aversions to certain foods thanks to bradstreet’s diets. she runs a popular autism blog that often criticizes pseudoscience. yet she empathizes with parents who go to doctors like bradstreet. “it’s a placebo, but it’s a placebo for the parent,” she says. “the alternative is so much harder to accept: the idea that you’ve allowed yourself to be fooled. ” * * * the placebo effect is arguably the most important psychological phenomenon in medicine. it is said to occur when an illness or the symptoms of one improve after the person undergoes a treatment that has no direct biological link to the improvement. but it’s more than that: placebos can have physiological effects, triggering the release of neurotransmitters and other brain chemicals, the same way that a prescription drug might. scientists today look at the placebo effect as not just an odd psychological quirk, but a window into how the brain mediates bodily functions. the script for most placebo effects runs this way: a doctor, scientist or other authority figure prescribes a treatment that promises some kind of physical or psychological effect. that creates a belief, or “expectancy,” as psychologists call it, that works in concert with cues from the doctor (a smile, a hand on the shoulder, a confident demeanor) and thousands of subconscious psychological associations between doctors, medicine, and healing. the brain translates that expectation into actual healing or relief from symptoms, as hormones and neurotransmitters, such as dopamine, serotonin, cannabinoids, opioids, and even the “hunger” hormone ghrelin, change the experience of, say, pain, anxiety or depression. in other words, expectation turns belief into reality. placebos are not new: hippocrates, the father of medicine, observed them avicenna, a medieval medical pioneer, warned physicians to beware of misleading positive effects when testing new remedies. in this century, placebo effects were written into the rules governing medical treatment. in 1962, the fda introduced the requirement that a drug candidate must outperform a placebo control in order to be approved. but the mechanism of the placebo effect has remained a mystery only in the past couple of decades has it come under serious neurological study. henry beecher, one of the founders of modern placebo research, famously found in 1955 that an average of 30 percent of people taking placebos respond to them. in truth, it’s more complicated. in trials of people suffering from conditions such as chronic pain, irritable bowel syndrome or depression, between 60 and 70 percent of people in the placebo arm find relief the number can be just 10 or 15 percent among people with other maladies. for the conditions with especially high   rates, it has become increasingly difficult to create new drugs, because even effective drugs cannot outperform the placebo. for a long time, experts assumed that placebos had little to no role in autism. one of the central features of autism is a diminished ability to process social information. so the conventional wisdom has been that people with autism would have trouble reading a doctor’s subtle social cues that can often drive placebo effects —  and, therefore, would not respond well to placebo or sham treatments. in fact, however, trials of autism therapies have been stymied for decades by large placebo responses. the most famous example was in the late 1990s, with the   trials of the hormone secretin. hopes ran high that secretin would be a good therapy for people with autism, but in a 1999 trial of 60 children with autism or pervasive developmental disorder, it failed to outperform the placebo. the commonly prescribed antidepressant citalopram met a similar fate in 2009. both drugs seemed effective in early tests until they were compared with a placebo control. in each case, about 30 percent of the participants in the placebo arm improved, which essentially canceled out the power of the drugs being tested. that number is not nearly as high as placebo responses seen in drug trials for pain or depression, but it is higher than expected for a condition that supposedly precludes placebo altogether. several teams are starting to look more carefully at the placebo effect in people with autism. their early results paint a fascinating picture of how belief affects not just people with the condition, but also their families. * * * research into the placebo effect in autism can be broken down into three rough categories. the first of these is the result of an experimental necessity: most measurements in a clinical trial rely on parents’ observations. “parents are exquisitely attuned to very subtle variations in behavior that may not really be apparent to other observers,” says adrian sandler, medical director of the olson huff center at mission children’s hospital in asheville, north carolina. sandler worked on the first   secretin trials. in autism studies, the participants themselves generally do not report how they feel instead, parents or researchers report their observations of the participants. as in merryday porch’s case, many parents notice changes after a treatment that don’t exist. this phenomenon is by no means limited to parents of children with autism. a group of scientists from the menninger clinic in houston, texas, gave sweet drinks to children whose parents described them as  . unbeknownst to the parents, the drinks were actually   but parents still rated their children’s behavior afterward as more hyperactive and erratic than before. along these lines, facilitated communication —  a popular technique in which children with autism use a keyboard as an assistant guides their hands —  has turned out to be a   ouija board, driven by the wishful thinking of the assistants. the placebo effect doesn’t only interfere with observations made by parents and caregivers: physicians can also easily become persuaded to see improvement in a child. one wrinkle here is that often the observed progress isn’t a mirage. in any course of treatment, people tend to take medicines when their condition is at its worst, and then attribute the relief they observe to the medicine rather than to the condition’s natural course. besides, development in all children happens in fits and starts. a   vitamin supplement can seem to be effective when, in reality, the change is due to a natural spurt in development. the second way placebos play out in autism research is more complicated. even if a parent is able to suppress the desire to see a positive outcome, she may reveal signs of her excitement. a new therapy can breathe hope and anticipation into a household. children, being naturally observant of their parents, may respond to this atmosphere by masking symptoms in order to please their parents. this kind of “ ” in which children pick up on cues and expectations from their parents, is common throughout pediatric research because, among other reasons, children are highly suggestible. “are we seeing things that are simply just relating to a parental placebo effect? or are parental expectations influencing the child, and then the child’s behavior changes?” asks rebecca jones, a neuroscientist at weill cornell medicine in new york. to pin down parents’ role in the placebo effect, jones, along with weill cornell clinical psychologist catherine lord, compared the accuracy of observations made by parents and clinicians with objective, quantitative measures. the results are unpublished, but jones says they suggest that researchers must take into account the contribution of expectation from all of the parties involved —  the trial participants, parents, and clinicians. in fact, parents’ opinions seem to predict how a child responds to placebo. for example, multiple studies have found that children whose parents are optimistic about a trial’s results at the outset have a more robust placebo response than do children of more   parents. a 2012 study showed that children prone to tantrums have fewer spells after they drink a flower essence that supposedly calms children, but is actually a placebo. the concoction seemed to work, but the researchers found that its success was more closely tied to the expectations of the parents than the observed behavior of the children. “if the adults expect little, they get little if they expect a lot, they get a lot,” says ami klin, director of the marcus autism center in atlanta and a professor at emory university. this disconnect between observed reality and biological reality makes it extremely difficult to measure how a treatment is performing in a clinical trial. in other words, expectation constantly muddies the scientific waters. sometimes, a placebo apparently affects researchers more than it affects the participants: in a 2009   of trials for depression treatments, researchers rated the participants’ improvement almost three times higher than the participants themselves did. in a similar   of irritable bowel syndrome treatments (a favorite topic of study for placebo researchers because of its high placebo rate) the clinicians rated improvement 50 percent higher than the participants did. it’s difficult enough to separate placebo from drug effects when participants report their own experiences, says karin jensen, a placebo researcher at the karolinska institute in stockholm, sweden, but it’s nearly impossible when other people are in the mix. the excitement in the media and the autism community over the secretin trials is a perfect example of this phenomenon, she says. “most of [autism research] is based on subjective ratings,” she says. “expectations were sky high, and so that was transferred to patients via parents and caretakers. ” of course, not all placebo responses are positive, especially when it comes to the wide world of questionable therapies. if a treatment is painful or uncomfortable, and a child is afraid of the therapy, she might change her behavior to mask her condition. although there’s little research into how fear might change the behavior of a child with autism, some in the autism community are convinced that it can play a big role. emma dalmayne, an autism advocate, has the condition, as do five of her six children. she says uncomfortable sham treatments —  such as bleaching agents that can damage the digestive system —  can cause a child to pretend to feel better out of fear. the treatments may seem to the child to be a punishment for her   behavior. “children aren’t stupid,” dalmayne says. “if you’re a child and you’ve been told you’ve got monsters living in your tummy and your mom wants to flush you with bleach,” she says, “you are going to stop the stimming behavior, the vocalizing and the flapping. ” misled by this sort of placebo effect, families may waste precious time, energy and, money on worthless treatments that, over time, may even be dangerous. * * * research on how people with autism respond to placebos may reveal not only new insights about autism, but how placebos work in a broad range of conditions. scientists often say that because placebo effects require complex traits such as   and social cognition, they are likely to be less powerful in people with intellectual disabilities. results of the few studies that have looked into this dynamic have turned out to be a bit more nuanced, however. one 2015   of 22 papers by jensen’s team showed that people with a whole host of conditions characterized by intellectual disabilities —  including down syndrome and the   fragile x and williams syndromes —  experience objectively measurable placebo responses. however, the study did find that individuals with higher intelligence quotients experience stronger placebo effects than those with lower ones. and those with dementia experience none. the 2009 study of citalopram for autism had a similarly informative finding. overall, the drug did not alleviate repetitive behaviors in children, but a more   analysis revealed an interesting pattern. children with the most severe symptoms responded significantly less to the placebo than did those with milder symptoms. children with autism may not respond as strongly to placebos based on verbal instructions (as in: “take this pill it will make you feel better”) as typical children do, though no one has studied that specifically, says luana colloca, a neuroscientist at the university of maryland in baltimore. but there are plenty of other ways a placebo effect might emerge, triggered simply by the act of taking a medication. “taking a pill is such a strong conditioned stimulus,” colloca says. “you don’t need to have strong expectations, you don’t need to have strong beliefs it’s such an automatic response. ” for example, if every time you take a pill, it eases your pain, eventually the pain relief may not depend on what’s in the pill, but rather on the act of popping the pill. in the case of pain, the mechanisms by which the brain responds to this repetitive conditioning —  by releasing natural opioids —  are well documented. in the case of autism, how placebos work is still anyone’s guess —  but there is some indication that statistical quirks and wishful thinking don’t fully explain what scientists are seeing so far, says sandler. “if you think you are better, you may actually be better. and there’s no reason to suppose that that kind of phenomenon might not occur in autism,” he says. it seems unlikely that parents are driving the entirety of these placebo effects —  otherwise the responses for the children with mild symptoms should be the same as for those with severe symptoms. researchers and parents aren’t always seeking to treat autism itself but rather the diverse set of conditions such as anxiety, depression or stomach pain that frequently accompany autism. these conditions are often highly responsive to placebos, and separating out which of them is responding to the treatment is nearly futile. still, there are steps scientists can take to better understand the placebo effect in autism. “i would be very interested to see trials in autism where there’s both objective measures of [a child’s] skills to see if they themselves display placebo effects, and the subjective ratings from parents, clinicians, teachers and caregivers,” says jensen —  something jones and lord’s unpublished research may get at. enough data like this, jensen says, and scientists might begin to tease apart where a parent’s expectation stops and a participant’s begins. testing treatments for the behaviors associated with autism is already complicated because of the condition’s notorious diversity, says jones. “when you add on something as complicated as the placebo effect, it almost feels overwhelming in terms of trying to piece out the different components. ” placebos complicate the search for medicines at every level. drugs are harder to bring to market, ineffective therapies take longer to discredit, and people are led by their false hopes in the worst cases, crackpot remedies can cause real harm. at the same time, placebos also offer a powerful glimpse into the power of the mind on the body. merryday porch, who has seen both sides of the power of placebo, says she respects how strong its pull can be. “very few are able to step away,” merryday porch says of her fellow parents. “desperation breeds gullibility, and hope can be unsinkable when it comes to one’s child. [the experience] taught me much about the power of the mind to see what one wants to see. ” this article appears courtesy of spectrum.\n",

      "unlike many of bradstreet’s clients, she wasn’t trying to “cure” callum’s autism, but rather improve a few of his symptoms, such as his lack of language skills\n",
      "and at first, she was thrilled with the regimen\n",
      "after taking cod liver oil, callum, who rarely spoke, began happily naming characters he saw on television\n",
      "her expectation —  her profound hope —  that the treatment might work was buoyed\n",
      "but even as her child seemed to be getting better, residual skepticism kept her from trying more involved, potentially harmful treatments\n",
      "doubts festered in her mind, aggravated by the fact that the same doctor prescribing the supplements was also selling them\n",
      "one day during an appointment, when merryday porch had to force her panicked son down on a table for yet another blood draw, she finally snapped\n",
      "“every instinct in me just told me: ‘just get out of here and don’t come back,’” she says\n",
      "so that’s what she did, giving up the pills and the diets for scientifically accepted treatments such as speech therapy\n",
      "bradstreet was eventually forced to leave florida and then investigated by the u\n",
      "s\n",
      "food and drug administration (fda) for selling fraudulent autism therapies, in particular, one treatment —  globulin component   factor —  related to the tests he ordered for callum\n",
      "soon after, he apparently took his own life\n",
      "today, merryday porch says bradstreet’s therapies were a waste of time and money, and that all callum’s gains during that time were either in her imagination or the natural course of his development\n",
      "if anything, she says, the treatments may have been detrimental\n",
      "she is grateful she never went in for alternative therapies with strong side effects, although she says callum —  now 7 years old and a happy child —  has aversions to certain foods thanks to bradstreet’s diets\n",
      "she runs a popular autism blog that often criticizes pseudoscience\n",
      "yet she empathizes with parents who go to doctors like bradstreet\n",
      "“it’s a placebo, but it’s a placebo for the parent,” she says\n",
      "“the alternative is so much harder to accept: the idea that you’ve allowed yourself to be fooled\n",
      "” * * * the placebo effect is arguably the most important psychological phenomenon in medicine\n",
      "it is said to occur when an illness or the symptoms of one improve after the person undergoes a treatment that has no direct biological link to the improvement\n",
      "but it’s more than that: placebos can have physiological effects, triggering the release of neurotransmitters and other brain chemicals, the same way that a prescription drug might\n",
      "scientists today look at the placebo effect as not just an odd psychological quirk, but a window into how the brain mediates bodily functions\n",
      "the script for most placebo effects runs this way: a doctor, scientist or other authority figure prescribes a treatment that promises some kind of physical or psychological effect\n",
      "that creates a belief, or “expectancy,” as psychologists call it, that works in concert with cues from the doctor (a smile, a hand on the shoulder, a confident demeanor) and thousands of subconscious psychological associations between doctors, medicine, and healing\n",
      "the brain translates that expectation into actual healing or relief from symptoms, as hormones and neurotransmitters, such as dopamine, serotonin, cannabinoids, opioids, and even the “hunger” hormone ghrelin, change the experience of, say, pain, anxiety or depression\n",
      "in other words, expectation turns belief into reality\n",
      "placebos are not new: hippocrates, the father of medicine, observed them avicenna, a medieval medical pioneer, warned physicians to beware of misleading positive effects when testing new remedies\n",
      "in this century, placebo effects were written into the rules governing medical treatment\n",
      "in 1962, the fda introduced the requirement that a drug candidate must outperform a placebo control in order to be approved\n",
      "but the mechanism of the placebo effect has remained a mystery only in the past couple of decades has it come under serious neurological study\n",
      "henry beecher, one of the founders of modern placebo research, famously found in 1955 that an average of 30 percent of people taking placebos respond to them\n",
      "in truth, it’s more complicated\n",
      "in trials of people suffering from conditions such as chronic pain, irritable bowel syndrome or depression, between 60 and 70 percent of people in the placebo arm find relief the number can be just 10 or 15 percent among people with other maladies\n",
      "for the conditions with especially high   rates, it has become increasingly difficult to create new drugs, because even effective drugs cannot outperform the placebo\n",
      "for a long time, experts assumed that placebos had little to no role in autism\n",
      "one of the central features of autism is a diminished ability to process social information\n",
      "so the conventional wisdom has been that people with autism would have trouble reading a doctor’s subtle social cues that can often drive placebo effects —  and, therefore, would not respond well to placebo or sham treatments\n",
      "in fact, however, trials of autism therapies have been stymied for decades by large placebo responses\n",
      "the most famous example was in the late 1990s, with the   trials of the hormone secretin\n",
      "hopes ran high that secretin would be a good therapy for people with autism, but in a 1999 trial of 60 children with autism or pervasive developmental disorder, it failed to outperform the placebo\n",
      "the commonly prescribed antidepressant citalopram met a similar fate in 2009\n",
      "both drugs seemed effective in early tests until they were compared with a placebo control\n",
      "in each case, about 30 percent of the participants in the placebo arm improved, which essentially canceled out the power of the drugs being tested\n",
      "that number is not nearly as high as placebo responses seen in drug trials for pain or depression, but it is higher than expected for a condition that supposedly precludes placebo altogether\n",
      "several teams are starting to look more carefully at the placebo effect in people with autism\n",
      "their early results paint a fascinating picture of how belief affects not just people with the condition, but also their families\n",
      "* * * research into the placebo effect in autism can be broken down into three rough categories\n",
      "the first of these is the result of an experimental necessity: most measurements in a clinical trial rely on parents’ observations\n",
      "“parents are exquisitely attuned to very subtle variations in behavior that may not really be apparent to other observers,” says adrian sandler, medical director of the olson huff center at mission children’s hospital in asheville, north carolina\n",
      "sandler worked on the first   secretin trials\n",
      "in autism studies, the participants themselves generally do not report how they feel instead, parents or researchers report their observations of the participants\n",
      "as in merryday porch’s case, many parents notice changes after a treatment that don’t exist\n",
      "this phenomenon is by no means limited to parents of children with autism\n",
      "a group of scientists from the menninger clinic in houston, texas, gave sweet drinks to children whose parents described them as  \n",
      "unbeknownst to the parents, the drinks were actually   but parents still rated their children’s behavior afterward as more hyperactive and erratic than before\n",
      "along these lines, facilitated communication —  a popular technique in which children with autism use a keyboard as an assistant guides their hands —  has turned out to be a   ouija board, driven by the wishful thinking of the assistants\n",
      "the placebo effect doesn’t only interfere with observations made by parents and caregivers: physicians can also easily become persuaded to see improvement in a child\n",
      "one wrinkle here is that often the observed progress isn’t a mirage\n",
      "in any course of treatment, people tend to take medicines when their condition is at its worst, and then attribute the relief they observe to the medicine rather than to the condition’s natural course\n",
      "besides, development in all children happens in fits and starts\n",
      "a   vitamin supplement can seem to be effective when, in reality, the change is due to a natural spurt in development\n",
      "the second way placebos play out in autism research is more complicated\n",
      "even if a parent is able to suppress the desire to see a positive outcome, she may reveal signs of her excitement\n",
      "a new therapy can breathe hope and anticipation into a household\n",
      "children, being naturally observant of their parents, may respond to this atmosphere by masking symptoms in order to please their parents\n",
      "this kind of “ ” in which children pick up on cues and expectations from their parents, is common throughout pediatric research because, among other reasons, children are highly suggestible\n",
      "“are we seeing things that are simply just relating to a parental placebo effect? or are parental expectations influencing the child, and then the child’s behavior changes?” asks rebecca jones, a neuroscientist at weill cornell medicine in new york\n",
      "to pin down parents’ role in the placebo effect, jones, along with weill cornell clinical psychologist catherine lord, compared the accuracy of observations made by parents and clinicians with objective, quantitative measures\n",
      "the results are unpublished, but jones says they suggest that researchers must take into account the contribution of expectation from all of the parties involved —  the trial participants, parents, and clinicians\n",
      "in fact, parents’ opinions seem to predict how a child responds to placebo\n",
      "for example, multiple studies have found that children whose parents are optimistic about a trial’s results at the outset have a more robust placebo response than do children of more   parents\n",
      "a 2012 study showed that children prone to tantrums have fewer spells after they drink a flower essence that supposedly calms children, but is actually a placebo\n",
      "the concoction seemed to work, but the researchers found that its success was more closely tied to the expectations of the parents than the observed behavior of the children\n",
      "“if the adults expect little, they get little if they expect a lot, they get a lot,” says ami klin, director of the marcus autism center in atlanta and a professor at emory university\n",
      "this disconnect between observed reality and biological reality makes it extremely difficult to measure how a treatment is performing in a clinical trial\n",
      "in other words, expectation constantly muddies the scientific waters\n",
      "sometimes, a placebo apparently affects researchers more than it affects the participants: in a 2009   of trials for depression treatments, researchers rated the participants’ improvement almost three times higher than the participants themselves did\n",
      "in a similar   of irritable bowel syndrome treatments (a favorite topic of study for placebo researchers because of its high placebo rate) the clinicians rated improvement 50 percent higher than the participants did\n",
      "it’s difficult enough to separate placebo from drug effects when participants report their own experiences, says karin jensen, a placebo researcher at the karolinska institute in stockholm, sweden, but it’s nearly impossible when other people are in the mix\n",
      "the excitement in the media and the autism community over the secretin trials is a perfect example of this phenomenon, she says\n",
      "“most of [autism research] is based on subjective ratings,” she says\n",
      "“expectations were sky high, and so that was transferred to patients via parents and caretakers\n",
      "” of course, not all placebo responses are positive, especially when it comes to the wide world of questionable therapies\n",
      "if a treatment is painful or uncomfortable, and a child is afraid of the therapy, she might change her behavior to mask her condition\n",
      "although there’s little research into how fear might change the behavior of a child with autism, some in the autism community are convinced that it can play a big role\n",
      "emma dalmayne, an autism advocate, has the condition, as do five of her six children\n",
      "she says uncomfortable sham treatments —  such as bleaching agents that can damage the digestive system —  can cause a child to pretend to feel better out of fear\n",
      "the treatments may seem to the child to be a punishment for her   behavior\n",
      "“children aren’t stupid,” dalmayne says\n",
      "“if you’re a child and you’ve been told you’ve got monsters living in your tummy and your mom wants to flush you with bleach,” she says, “you are going to stop the stimming behavior, the vocalizing and the flapping\n",
      "” misled by this sort of placebo effect, families may waste precious time, energy and, money on worthless treatments that, over time, may even be dangerous\n",
      "* * * research on how people with autism respond to placebos may reveal not only new insights about autism, but how placebos work in a broad range of conditions\n",
      "scientists often say that because placebo effects require complex traits such as   and social cognition, they are likely to be less powerful in people with intellectual disabilities\n",
      "results of the few studies that have looked into this dynamic have turned out to be a bit more nuanced, however\n",
      "one 2015   of 22 papers by jensen’s team showed that people with a whole host of conditions characterized by intellectual disabilities —  including down syndrome and the   fragile x and williams syndromes —  experience objectively measurable placebo responses\n",
      "however, the study did find that individuals with higher intelligence quotients experience stronger placebo effects than those with lower ones\n",
      "and those with dementia experience none\n",
      "the 2009 study of citalopram for autism had a similarly informative finding\n",
      "overall, the drug did not alleviate repetitive behaviors in children, but a more   analysis revealed an interesting pattern\n",
      "children with the most severe symptoms responded significantly less to the placebo than did those with milder symptoms\n",
      "children with autism may not respond as strongly to placebos based on verbal instructions (as in: “take this pill it will make you feel better”) as typical children do, though no one has studied that specifically, says luana colloca, a neuroscientist at the university of maryland in baltimore\n",
      "but there are plenty of other ways a placebo effect might emerge, triggered simply by the act of taking a medication\n",
      "“taking a pill is such a strong conditioned stimulus,” colloca says\n",
      "“you don’t need to have strong expectations, you don’t need to have strong beliefs it’s such an automatic response\n",
      "” for example, if every time you take a pill, it eases your pain, eventually the pain relief may not depend on what’s in the pill, but rather on the act of popping the pill\n",
      "in the case of pain, the mechanisms by which the brain responds to this repetitive conditioning —  by releasing natural opioids —  are well documented\n",
      "in the case of autism, how placebos work is still anyone’s guess —  but there is some indication that statistical quirks and wishful thinking don’t fully explain what scientists are seeing so far, says sandler\n",
      "“if you think you are better, you may actually be better\n",
      "and there’s no reason to suppose that that kind of phenomenon might not occur in autism,” he says\n",
      "it seems unlikely that parents are driving the entirety of these placebo effects —  otherwise the responses for the children with mild symptoms should be the same as for those with severe symptoms\n",
      "researchers and parents aren’t always seeking to treat autism itself but rather the diverse set of conditions such as anxiety, depression or stomach pain that frequently accompany autism\n",
      "these conditions are often highly responsive to placebos, and separating out which of them is responding to the treatment is nearly futile\n",
      "still, there are steps scientists can take to better understand the placebo effect in autism\n",
      "“i would be very interested to see trials in autism where there’s both objective measures of [a child’s] skills to see if they themselves display placebo effects, and the subjective ratings from parents, clinicians, teachers and caregivers,” says jensen —  something jones and lord’s unpublished research may get at\n",
      "enough data like this, jensen says, and scientists might begin to tease apart where a parent’s expectation stops and a participant’s begins\n",
      "testing treatments for the behaviors associated with autism is already complicated because of the condition’s notorious diversity, says jones\n",
      "“when you add on something as complicated as the placebo effect, it almost feels overwhelming in terms of trying to piece out the different components\n",
      "” placebos complicate the search for medicines at every level\n",
      "drugs are harder to bring to market, ineffective therapies take longer to discredit, and people are led by their false hopes in the worst cases, crackpot remedies can cause real harm\n",
      "at the same time, placebos also offer a powerful glimpse into the power of the mind on the body\n",
      "merryday porch, who has seen both sides of the power of placebo, says she respects how strong its pull can be\n",
      "“very few are able to step away,” merryday porch says of her fellow parents\n",
      "“desperation breeds gullibility, and hope can be unsinkable when it comes to one’s child\n",

      "text:  kevin durant’s exit hurts an oklahoma mourning much more than basketball throughout the 20th century, my home state of oklahoma was known for misfortune: the trail of tears the dust bowl the oklahoma city bombing the rogers and hammerstein musical. despite a penchant for producing country music superstars, oklahoma remained a tragic diversion en route to greener western pastures. a bathroom stop on route 66. flyover territory.  this dynamic now applies to kevin durant in light of monday’s announcement that he will end a frustrating tenure with the oklahoma city thunder in order to pursue a title with a golden state warriors team that recently bested the only healthy playoff team okc has had since the 2012 finals. ••• if the 20th century was rough on the sooner state, the young 21st century had been shaping up unbelievably kindly. an oil and gas industry that had teetered on the verge of collapse for decades experienced a resurgence thanks to the advent of hydraulic fracturing (more commonly referred to as “fracking”) turning ghost towns into hubs replete with hotels and outback steakhouses. flush with cash, a team of oklahoma city energy billionaires purchased the nba’s seattle supersonics in 2006 under strict conditions not to move the team, a policy that was soon to be reversed.  dizzy at the windfall, oklahomans packed the ford center to watch exciting young players like russell westbrook, serge ibaka, james harden, and durant. seemingly overnight, the most common conversation encountered by oklahomans abroad ceased to be, “you’re from oklahoma? i’ve seen your musical. ” clayton dorris, a digital marketer with oklahoma city’s bigwing interactive, noted that, “it didn’t matter which part of the world i was visiting, a mention of being from oklahoma would elicit ‘oh, kevin durant! ’” to hear oklahomans speak of the early days of the franchise is to hear variations on a singular sentiment: in contrast to other middling plains states, the presence of a sports franchise filled with     talent leant oklahoma a sense of cultural validation. kids around the world donned okc’s signature blue and orange.    economies are cyclical and residents understand this. what’s different about the 2016 cycle, however, is that this time the entire fraught dynamic of prosperity, promise and collapse has found expression in the words and actions of a single person: durant. ••• with few exceptions, american popular culture is created on the coasts and trickles inland into the obscure places that serve as sacrificial spaces necessary to maintain the rest of the country. a genuinely american fear of living and working in obscurity drives the young and upwardly mobile from these places where culture is often preserved rather than created, preventing change and permeating communities with   humility. the feeling of locational inadequacy is especially palpable in prairie towns where, as my grandfather, a born and bred okie, put it: “people shower after work, not before. ” equally strong is the relief that arises within citizens once their overlooked home receives national recognition.  in oklahoma’s case, the seeds of resurgence grew out of tragedy. tired of the city’s status as rundown   oklahoma city officials began attempts at revitalizing the capital’s depressed downtown depot in the wake of the oklahoma city bombing, and by 1998 the area  —   dubbed bricktown  —   had become a pristine entertainment district. seemingly overnight, oklahoma city had acquired the amenities people in places like dallas take for granted or even mock: chain restaurants, retail shopping, places to host bachelor parties.  the second indication that oklahoma was to enjoy a cultural ascendance came about as a result of hurricane katrina. in the storm’s aftermath, the nba sought a temporary home for the displaced hornets, and oklahoma city seemed like a natural destination, boasting an   arena and the kind of sports fans that seem to exist exclusively in     places. despite a dismal . 470 win percentage during the hornets’ tenure in okc, local support was ravenous, prompting     chris paul to tell the houston chronicle that playing in oklahoma gives “you get the feeling you’re part of something special”.  david stern and company took note, and  —   with chesapeake executives clay bennett and aubrey mcclendon already in talks to purchase the supersonics  —   the nba brass began working to get a team into a hungry market. the bond between durant and his new city wasn’t immediate, but oklahomans fell for the lanky superstar, who seemed as unassuming of his physical resources as the state itself. in 2013, when durant donated $1m to relief efforts in the wake of a devastating ef5 tornado that cut a   swath of destruction through suburban oklahoma city, his status as local hero was cemented. according to o alan noble, a professor at oklahoma baptist university and contributor to the atlantic, “there’s no question that kd represented more than basketball to oklahoma. between   …     all the local work he did and his vocal identification with the city as his home   …     many people can’t think of oklahoma city without thinking of kevin durant. he gave us something to be proud of and enjoy through economic downturns and natural disasters. we were proud that he played for our city and we were grateful to be able to be his fans. his attitude felt oklahoman. quiet, but confident. kind, but deadly. ” it was likely this attachment that led durant to repeatedly state that he wasn’t a someone who looks for shortcuts to success. a recently unearthed 2010 durant tweet is emblematic of his rhetoric: “now everybody wanna play for the heat and the lakers? let’s go back to being competitive and going at these peoples. ”  to citizens of a state whose economic   had so often been rocked by tough decisions and esoteric global trends, this was especially reassuring. ••• fracking money brought a professional sports franchise to oklahoma, but oil and gas money are certainly not new to the region. though the area was initially dismissed as “indian territory,” federal interest in the land renewed in the 1890s with the discovery of vast amounts of crude petroleum waiting to be drilled beneath what is now oklahoma city. oklahoma’s 1907 statehood occurred within a decade of the territory’s first producing well. the subsequent story of the state is a story of peaks and valleys. there was the original statehood oil boom that lasted throughout the 1920s and then the dust bowl exodus that drove thousands to california. following two more diminishing   cycles, a variety of factors cinched demand to the extent that the number of new producing wells in oklahoma reached lows in the late 1990s not seen since statehood. unfortunately, attempts to solve this problem would inadvertently create many others. the ticket out of the late 90s oil crisis, according to chesapeake energy   mcclendon, lay in the use of fracking  —   a controversial technique that transformed previously unreachable shale deposits into drillable real estate. mcclendon was right: new technologies for obtaining oil and gas changed the industry in a variety of unintended ways.  these methods revitalized american oil, but also lowered the amount of capital required to drill, which removed a significant barrier to the industry for many startups and gave a previously excluded segment of the population a shot at the action. historically high oil prices began to incentivize increased drilling investment just before the thunder came to town. new companies began to change the way business was done, borrowing heavily to purchase equipment and thereby capitalize on the influx of newly reachable, unprecedentedly profitable oil and gas. the problem is that this type of   business model almost never works out in the long run.   drilling enterprises quickly felt the strain of debt, struggling to repay loans on rapidly depreciating drilling equipment. as new ventures began under this aggressive model, the market flooded with oil, prices plummeted, and companies suddenly had to produce twice as much in order to make payments on equipment, further exacerbating the surplus. an era of stable supply and demand had been thrown out of whack, angering opec, which subsequently slashed oil prices in order to flush out american fracking upstarts and protect its historically powerful selling position. per barrel prices reached historic lows. this imbalance between supply and demand tore into oklahoma, where the workforce has become disproportionately involved in energy. on the one hand, major players in the american industry shut off wells, sending workers home indefinitely while waiting for demand to rebound. on the other, heavily leveraged upstarts succumbed to the unsustainability of their business model, with many oklahoma ventures closing shop. residents who had experienced a recent surge in the value of their labor now found themselves sitting at home without a paycheck or other viable career options.  the ramifications of the downturn have been brutal: oklahoma’s economy was the worst or second worst in the nation throughout  . sales tax revenues subsequently plummeted to   lows as 11, 300 jobs disappeared within a   span, including nearly a fifth of mcclendon’s chesapeake energy corporation’s 2, 500 oklahoma city employees. oklahoma now faces a $1. 3bn budget shortfall, leading to a   23. 6% drop in   education funding and deep cuts to law enforcement. while it’s not like the sharpshooting forward killed off the energy industry, the fact remains that durant played his final game in oklahoma city during a season in which even basic tasks like funding education seem impossible, before heading for an infamously cosmopolitan destination. for those marooned back on the plains without work, the cruel tidiness of the narrative continues to sink in. ••• while the basketball implications of durant’s departure are clear enough  —   okc is losing a former league mvp  —   the organizational prospects may be even darker. the prosperity that enabled bennett and mcclendon’s (imaginatively named) professional basketball club llc to move the team in the first place has dissipated, leaving behind a state in which bridges crumble and public schools operate only four days per week. franchise founder aubrey mcclendon died in march after crashing his car into a wall hours after prosecutors announced intentions to indict the owner on charges of conspiracy to suppress land prices. within hours of the crash, crass speculation began, with some locals arguing that the energy tycoon took his own life after federal investigations revealed mcclendon’s financial situation to be eroding. conventional wisdom holds that these ownership difficulties could compound the thunder front office’s troubles in the wake of durant’s departure, leaving the franchise on shakier footing than fans realize. whether or not this is true, it is no stretch to say that okc’s value as a small market franchise has been thus far inflated by general manager sam presti’s preternatural ability to draft undervalued talent, and that in the absence of bankable new superstars, the city may not be as able to sustain a rebuilding period as larger markets.  others have pointed to presti’s penchant for dealing players in trades before they leave for nothing in unrestricted free agency, arguing that the thunder gm will now lean even more heavily on the strategy of at least getting something back for exiting players in light of durant’s (arguably) duplicitous departure. this makes recent reports of westbrook’s unwillingness to extend his time in okc all the more disconcerting for thunder fans. what if a spurned presti calls westbrook’s bluff the way he called james harden’s in 2012? worse, what if westbrook, like durant, initially communicates a desire to stay only to be seduced by a sexier city with immediate title hopes, leaving the thunder with nothing? if any one of those worst case scenarios coincide with continued difficulties for bennett’s energy holdings, there’s a small chance that oklahoma city might not have a team at all in the future.  ••• what stings fans most about monday’s news is the realization that despite all appearances, they had not, in fact, found a kindred spirit, someone with whom they could weather the floods, tornados and   earthquakes. perhaps this was an unfair assumption for fans to make in the first place, and one that surely seems quaint and naïve to those on the outside, but it was the dominant local perception. o alan noble doesn’t blame fans, noting an inherent contradiction: “what draws fans is when they can identify with a player. but it’s also a business, and players have the right and responsibility to make the best decision for themselves. we can’t have it both ways. if the nba wants to encourage a tight bond between local fans and a player, we should expect those fans to be hurt when the player makes a decision that is good for himself but not that community. ”  for his part, durant eagerly leaned into his role as signifier of state values, tweeting criticism when players left small markets to join other superstars and emphasizing loyalty in multiple interviews. his decision to join the warriors comes as a contradiction of a decade worth of  . predictably, the enthusiasm that once led oklahomans to describe durant as representative of the state’s homegrown work ethic has turned to bemusement and even rage (for instance) at what is locally perceived, fairly or not, as a decision to abandon oklahoma for the ‘easy way out,’ a guaranteed shot at a title with a team located close to america’s most   gold mine  —   silicon valley (even if oakland itself has its own economic problems). while durant could probably have won a governor’s race in oklahoma, his status in oakland may more closely resemble that of historical footnote to golden state’s continued success  —   a versatile scorer who helped revitalize an   team (think clyde drexler in houston, 1995). rather than having the hopes of an entire state resting on his shoulders, it’s possible that the absence of messianic pressure is actually one aspect of what helped lure him to golden state in the first place. after all, the man never asked to become a signifier of statewide success for three million people.  meanwhile, oklahomans remain unable to control their state’s destiny, weathering one more in a long line of letdowns as a result of financial concerns that leave citizens beholden to state governments and corporate whims. the sense one gets when discussing the implications of durant’s departure with residents is that they’re saddened by oklahoma’s inability to hold on to good things. they’re frustrated by the outsized financial and cultural pressures that drive prosperity out of the center of the country and toward the coast. oklahomans loved the way the presence of an nba superstar made their state matter to people who had only ever flown over it. and while they begrudgingly respect durant’s decision from a labor v management perspective, they’re blown away by the departure monday’s news represents from the image and ethos he spent a decade cultivating, an ethos so many bought uncritically took at face value.  perhaps saddest of all for those reflecting on the ups and downs of the past eight years is that residents of the sooner state are once again left to kick themselves for buying lines that were too good to be true while they pick up the pieces. for better or worse, kevin durant had come to serve as the last vestige of a brief era of prosperity. likewise, basketball had been an oddly reliable outlet for catharsis in a community whose citizens seem to suffer more than their fair share of hardship. so while it is inevitably tempting to sneer and wonder what could cause otherwise functional adults to shed tears over basketball, it’s worth remembering that oklahomans are, in so many ways, mourning much more than basketball.\n",

      "text:  in ‘groundbreaking’ case, franciscan friars charged with allowing abuse of at least 80 kids        in a     case, prosecutors in pennsylvania announced charges on tuesday against three franciscan friars who they say facilitated the abuse of dozens of children. prosecutors say that all three men knew about sexual abuse allegations against brother stephen baker dating back to the 1980s but that the three friars continued to place baker in jobs that gave him access to children, up until 2010. confronted with a lawsuit that made the accusations public, baker killed himself in 2013, at age 62, in the monastery where he lived. on monday, state prosecutors announced that three men who supervised him  —   brothers anthony m. criscitelli, 61, robert j. d’aversa, 69, and giles a. schinelli, 73  —   are each charged with one count of endangering the welfare of children and one count of criminal conspiracy.   [‘payout chart’ for molestation: secret archive in pa. held chilling details of clergy abuse]   “these men knew there was a child predator in their organization. yet they continued to put him in positions where he had countless opportunities to prey upon children,” pennsylvania attorney general kathleen kane said in a statement. “their silence resulted in immeasurable pain and suffering for so many victims. these men turned a blind eye to the innocent children they were trusted to protect. ” kane’s office also conducted an investigation into the   diocese in pennsylvania which produced a damning grand jury report earlier this month. that report chronicled alleged abuses committed by 35 priests, dating to the 1950s, in wrenching detail. but it did not recommend charges against anyone. most of the priests named in the report have died, and the statute of limitations has expired in some cases. but when the grand jury turned its attention to friars based in hollidaysburg, pa.  —   the franciscan friars, third order regulars, province of the immaculate conception  —   it found cause to charge three men who served in the same job in the organization, that of minister provincial. the minister provincial controls which friar works where, prosecutors said. so criscitelli, d’aversa and schinelli were the ones who placed baker in the jobs which he allegedly used as opportunities to molest children, for years.   [even in the year of ‘spotlight’ and pope francis, the boston globe casts off its catholic news site]   marci hamilton, a constitutional law scholar at yeshiva university and prominent attorney for child sex abuse survivors, said that the pennsylvania attorney general’s decision to charge men who supervised abusers is rare. “what we’re seeing is the incremental improvement in the way in which prosecutors are seeing these issues and dealing with them. this sends a real message of support to the victims, not just of stephen baker but across the country,” hamilton said. she said supervisors have only previously been charged with child endangerment in catholic church cases three times anywhere in the country. the first case, also in pennsylvania, led to a philadelphia priest’s conviction in 2012. that case set an important precedent in pennsylvania, hamilton said: “the supervisor does not have to have direct contact with children to be found responsible for their welfare. ” hamilton noted that monday’s charges are also the first such charges in the country to target a religious order. orders like the franciscans are notoriously secretive, and the worldwide regularity among monasteries of the order might help prosecutors elsewhere to bring cases similar to the pennsylvania one, she said.   [watch singers all over the world join in ‘hallelujah’ in this impressive mormon video]   “this is groundbreaking. we have not seen a prosecutor charge an order of priests,” hamilton said. the franciscan order released a statement that said: we are deeply saddened by the news released today by the pennsylvania office of attorney general. with compassion for the victims and their families, as well as for the catholic family and the community at large, the province and its leadership have worked to cooperate with the office of attorney general throughout this investigation in the hope that this information could shed light on events that the province, too, struggles to understand. the province extends its most sincere apologies to the victims and to the communities who have been harmed. it invites the community to join it in prayer for healing and understanding, and for all the priests and brothers who honor their vocations and the church. before baker died, the franciscans settled a lawsuit with 11 victims who said baker abused them in the 1980s and 1990s when he worked at a school in ohio, according to the pittsburgh  . that settlement prompted 25 students from bishop mccort catholic high school in johnstown, pa. where baker taught from 1992 to 2000, to say they had also been abused by him.   [why donald trump is tearing evangelicals apart]   now, the grand jury said, more than 80 bishop mccort students have said they were victimized by baker. prosecutors said that baker repeatedly said he was treating boys as an athletic trainer, which he was not trained to do. then he would grope their genitals and penetrate them with his finger. prosecutors pointed to repeated chances that the friars had to stop baker: schinelli sent baker for a psychological evaluation and got back the answer that baker should not have contact with children; then schinelli assigned baker to bishop mccort. d’aversa found an accusation of sexual abuse credible in 2000. he removed baker from the school, then put him in charge of overnight youth retreats around the country. then in 2008, d’aversa assigned baker to another job, at st. aloysius college, where the grand jury found that he abused three minors. criscitelli let baker work in a shopping mall, again around children, prosecutors said. want more stories about faith? follow acts of faith on twitter or sign up for our newsletter. the u. s. house just voted unanimously that the islamic state commits ‘genocide.’ now what? barber refuses to cut transgender army veteran’s hair, citing bible the mystery of billy graham’s inscription in a bible for donald trump\n",

      "text:  this student put 50 million stolen research articles online. and they’re free.  alexandra elbakyan is a highbrow pirate in hiding. the    graduate student from kazakhstan is operating a searchable online database of nearly 50 million stolen scholarly journal articles, shattering the $10    paywall of academic publishers. elbakyan has kept herself beyond the reach of a federal judge who late last year issued an injunction against her site, noting that damages could total $150, 000 per article  —   a sum that applied and computational harmonic analysis, a journal in her database, could help calculate. but she is not hiding from responsibility. “there are many ways to argue that copyright infringement is not theft, but even if it is, it is justified in this case,” she said in an   interview via google. “all content should be copied without restriction. but for education and research, copyright laws are especially damaging. ” elbakyan is pursuing a master’s degree in the history of science while pursuing the worldwide liberation of knowledge from, as she sees it, the tyranny of   publishers. her ideology was shaped growing up in a former soviet republic where access to information and the internet was difficult.   alexandra elbakyan is shown in this undated handout photo. she is the creator of   which provides free access to 50 million research articles that are supposed to be behind paywalls. (courtesy photo)  she has even been compared to robin hood, although she said, “sometimes i think it is not a good comparison, since what he was doing was illegal. and sharing books and research articles should not be illegal. ” many academics, university librarians and longtime advocates for open scholarly research are closely following elbakyan’s efforts. they believe she is finally giving academic publishers their napster moment, a reference to the illegal   service that disrupted and permanently altered the industry.   “while we don’t condone fraud and using illegal sources, i will say that i appreciate how she is shining a light on just how out of whack the system is of providing easy access to basic information that our universities and scholars need to advance science and research,” said heather joseph, executive director of sparc, an organization that advocates for open access to research. “this has been a problem for decades. ” but to publishers, the only example elbakyan is setting is that of a thief. “this is outright piracy,” said lui simpson, executive director of international enforcement and trade policy for the association of american publishers. “nobody is justified in doing this. ” ‘as many papers as they want for free’  like other content businesses, the journal industry has largely moved online. but unlike newspaper, magazine, or other information industries, academic publishers have avoided giving their content away free. scholarly publishing, the financial times has said, is “the business the internet could not kill. ”  [why digital natives prefer reading in print. yes, you read that right.]  in many ways, academia has itself to blame for its dilemma. higher education is a    world in which administrators judge professors based on their scholarly output, basically outsourcing the validation of a scholar’s worth. that gives journals enormous intrinsic value, if not to society then to academics themselves. brands such as the academy of management annals and the annual review of condensed matter physics matter. scholars and librarians say the publishers then use this to take advantage of them. researchers sign over the copyright and provide their work, often taxpayer funded, free to publishers who then get other researchers to review the papers  —   also free. the publishers then sell journal subscriptions  —   some titles cost more than $5, 000 a year  —   back to universities and the federal government. and if someone wants an article, that costs about $35, so that person is paying for the research and to read the results. “that means that i, as a taxpayer, (am) paying for the research and paying again for the benefit of reading it,” a man who identified himself as john dowd wrote to the white house office of science and technology policy as part of a forum on public access. “this seems patently unfair. ” critics also say that publishers raise prices faster than inflation  —   each side argues pricing changes in differing and confusing ways  —   and further increase their revenue by continually adding new journals for universities to subscribe to individually or in packages. there are now 28, 100 journals publishing 2. 5 million articles a year. expenses for journals and other subscriptions have risen 456 percent since 1986, according to the association of research libraries.  [where are the books? libraries under fire as they shift from print to digital]  for researchers whose libraries have cut back on journal spending or for those working in kazakhstan and other developing countries, spending $35 per paper or using interlibrary loans is, they complain, too onerous and slows down their research. some trade articles on twitter and reddit. pirating was a skill elbakyan learned growing up in almaty, the largest city in kazakhstan, where internet access was extremely limited and content  —   books, music, movies  —   was expensive. that experience shaped this belief: “all content,” she declares, “should be copied without restriction. ” elbakyan has studied neuroscience and consciousness in labs at georgia tech and   university in freiburg, germany. at first, she pirated papers for herself and other researchers. she noticed so many requests that she decided to automate the process, setting up   four years ago.    connects to a database of stolen papers. if a user requests a paper in that database,   serves it up. if the paper is not there,   uses library passwords it has collected to find a paper, provides it to the searcher, then dumps the paper in the database. the site can be clunky to use, often sending users to web pages in foreign languages. elbakyan and her supporters have said the passwords were donated by those sympathetic to her cause. but she also acknowledges that some passwords were obtained using the kind of phishing methods that hackers use to dupe people out of financial information. “it may be well possible that phished passwords ended up being used at ” she said. “i did not send any phishing emails to anyone myself. the exact source of the passwords was never personally important to me. ” a legal war launched the industry watched closely as   use grew, with more than 150, 000 stolen papers downloaded per day, according to elbakyan. although publishers say those downloads represent a small fraction of all papers legally obtained, the industry decided to fight back last year.  elsevier, the world’s largest journal publisher, sued elbakyan in new york federal court, alleging copyright infringement and computer fraud. the company alleges that she and others operate “an international network of piracy and copyright infringement by circumventing legal and authorized means of access. ” elbakyan was offered help to retain an attorney, but she never got one, instead writing a letter to the court explaining her actions. “elsevier,” she wrote, “operates by racket: if you do not send money, you will not read any papers. on my website, any person can read as many papers as they want for free, and sending donations is their free will. why elsevier cannot work like this, i wonder?” a judge issued a preliminary injunction against  . elbakyan simply switched domains, keeping the database available.  her efforts bring to mind aaron swartz, a prominent computer programmer in boston who was charged with computer fraud for allegedly stealing thousands of academic papers from jstor, a large repository. he later killed himself.  publishers acknowledge they can probably never catch up to elbakyan, yet they are adamant that   will not harm them or evolve into a future business model the way that napster ultimately led to apple’s itunes  —   and dramatic revenue losses for record labels. but the risk for publishers is that if library funding struggles continue, forcing deep cutbacks on subscriptions, professors will turn to   more, causing a slow erosion of the industry. a recent survey by university of southern california and california state university librarians of more than 250 academics found that 41 percent “don’t care” about copyright. thirty percent think “information should be free. ” publishers and experts on academic publishing acknowledge that the industry has a tougher story to sell these days. “people often say to me, ‘you don’t pay the authors. you don’t pay the reviewers. you hardly print anymore. the web is free. why do you charge? ’” said h. frederick dylla, the former director of the american institute of physics and board member of the association of american publishers. “it sounds like a compelling argument. but it actually isn’t. ” albert greco, a publishing expert at fordham university who is working on a book about scholarly publishing, said those making that argument are forgetting everything they learned or should have learned in economics class. “there are costs,” he said. “does the washington post have a paywall?” yes. “so is it fair then if some   student wants to really follow the supreme court and doesn’t have the money to pay?” greco said. “life is a bitter mystery. we can’t give everything away for free. it’s not that kind of country. ” even with the shift away from print, publishers say they still provide valuable services. kent anderson, an academic publishing consultant, has posted a list of “96 things publishers do” on the blog scholarly kitchen  —   from training and managing peer reviewers to preventing plagiarism to building interactive components into digital versions. anderson said in an interview that the controversy over academic publishing has become “an emotional and social crusade” that bends the facts. sure, there are more journals and articles being published, but he said the increases are in line with the growth in federal research funding. the real problem: library budgets haven’t kept up. “ultimately,” he wrote in a post on scholarly kitchen, “the root cause of larger information expenditures is a growth in research funding, researcher numbers, and   careers. ” an open access movement librarians, of course, disagree. they say that publishers are too opportunistic in generating ideas for revenue. they also point to data showing that journals from nonprofit publishers are cheaper than   journals, sometimes by more than 50 percent. whether elbakyan’s actions and the resulting controversy fuel a massive disruption to the industry, it is clear, critics say, that   academic publishing is facing regulatory and competitive head winds. the white house office of science and technology policy is mandating that agencies funding more than $100 million in research require the final,   version of the manuscript  —   if not the published paper  —   to be freely available within 12 months of publication. a movement for   journals is building momentum, with about 7, 300 now in circulation.   journals, which include the popular plos one, typically charge researchers more than $1, 000 for publication but make the papers instantly available free online. universities also are setting up repositories for their faculty to post papers, although only in manuscript form. cold spring harbor laboratory hosts a web site for scientists to post their papers  —   without peer review  —   before submitting them to journals. industry representatives say they welcome competition from   journals, but they also say those publications lack the intellectual rigor and clout that professors need to advance their careers. instead, they are adding   options to their journals  —   sometimes with fees double that of what the   charge, frustrating researchers. elsevier says it is the     publisher, publishing 20, 000   articles last year. how this all ends, nobody really knows. in the meantime, elbakyan is adding to her collection of stolen papers every day. where is she? “the exact location is secret,” she said. can she ever be stopped? “it depends on my expertise,” she said. “can i outsmart these guys?” or has she already?   read more:    a ransomware cyberattack cripples major   system    are mass shootings contagious?

[in ‘sexting’ case, manassas city police want to photograph teen in sexually explict manner, lawyers say]   beginning in january 2014, sims was placed on home confinement, could not use a cell phone and could only leave home to go to school, osbourn high in manassas. when his trial arrived in june 2014, richardson had to dismiss the charge because he could not prove sims’ age, his lawyer, jessica harbeson foster, said. leaving the courtroom, “abbott told trey, menacingly,” glasberg wrote, “words to the effect, ‘this isn’t over’ and ‘i will be back. ’”    alexandria civil rights attorney victor m. glasberg, who is representing trey sims in his suit against prince william county authorities.

[manassas city teen placed on probation in sexting case where police sought photos]   sims completed his probation and the charges were dismissed last august. but glasberg said the episode “derailed his college plans,” and he is now working after graduating high school.  the suit notes that sims moved to manassas city to escape   parents, and had been a good student and football and basketball player at osbourn high. meanwhile, abbott filed a libel suit against sims’ criminal attorney, foster, for comments made in the post, but dropped it last year, not long after glasberg had issued notice to the police and prosecutors that he was preparing a civil suit. glasberg said sims did not want to let the case die. “there are some things,” glasberg said, “that are so outrageously inappropriate that somebody’s got to blow the whistle and say, ‘you can’t do this. ’” government officials may not claim sovereign immunity from constitutional claims, for actions taken in the course of their job, glasberg said. but they may claim qualified immunity, for actions they did not know would lead to constitutional violations. sims is alleging that his fourth amendment right not to be unreasonably searched was violated by both his arrest and the photography of his genitalia, and that richardson and abbott conspired to violate sims’ civil rights after sims declined a plea offer from richardson. glasberg is seeking both actual and punitive damages.\n",

of the 1831 slave rebellion led by nat turner, debuted to notable acclaim at sundance early this year. but it took on a different feel when college rape allegations against parker and his   for the film emerged during promotion for the movie. and then again when news broke that the alleged victim killed herself in 2012. “important,” now, is being deployed to help sway those who remain critical of or conflicted about parker, the birth of a nation’s writer, director, and star. amid the strong criticism of parker that’s ensued, there have been many calls to prioritize the significance of the movie over any personal feelings about the filmmaker. again and again, cast members, critics, and supporters have suggested both explicitly and implicitly that the birth of a nation should be seen because it’s an “important” work. but what exactly makes a film required viewing despite personal ambivalence or objection? what does “important” mean? the birth of a nation is important insofar as any narrative about slavery, race, or other parts of america’s dark past is. films in this tradition are valuable because they demand a continued reckoning with a history that’s too easy to forget or gloss over, and they also explore how the impact of that past continues into the present. but the fact that the birth of a nation is representatively important as a movie doesn’t mean that it’s good cinema, or even a necessary addition to the genre of stories about slavery. grappling with the birth of a nation  one   meaningful feature of the film is its historical grounding in one of the bloodiest slave rebellions on record: nat turner’s revolt in virginia, which resulted in the deaths of over 50 white people and the subsequent killing of hundreds of blacks as retribution. the birth of a nation doesn’t spare its audience the powerful and disturbing images of beatings, force feedings, and a litany of other atrocities that supposedly motivated turner’s rebellion. nor should it. but aside from its status as one of the deadliest, there’s not a widespread consensus among historians that turner’s uprising had critical,   consequences for the institution of slavery or the people who benefited from it. further, little is actually known about turner himself aside from a few sparse historical accounts and the confessional he wrote prior to his execution —  a document that deserves scrutiny since it was produced by a white attorney during turner’s confinement and published after turner’s death. this knowledge vacuum would make it difficult for a filmmaker (or anyone) to fill in the blanks about turner’s life and motivations without significant editorializing. and parker does editorialize, choosing to include scenes and tropes that viewers may bristle at: at least two instances of the brutalization and rape of black women and the portrayal of turner as the constant, morally unambiguous hero. but even as a narrative about slavery in general, the birth of a nation doesn’t break any new ground that would make it essential viewing. rather, the movie retreads some of the same emotional and visual terrain as roots, 12 years a slave, and django unchained —  and in some cases it does so less artfully. there are familiar tropes: the at once beautiful and devastating scenery of antebellum plantations with lush foliage being toiled by black bodies bent under the watchful eye of an overseer. the frustrating uncle tom house slave and the benevolent white benefactor. the commonness of unspeakable cruelty. parker, it seems, is trying to convey the strength, bravery, and agency of slaves in the face of unimaginable atrocities. turner’s motivation —  solidified during his travels as a preacher to his fellow slaves —  becomes answering a moral call to stand up for his brethren and himself. a reading of turner’s own words reflects far more religious fanaticism than moral imperative. much of the heart and feeling infused into the birth of a nation are of parker’s own design. and even in these instances, intended to humanize an enigmatic historical figure, the film offers   moments of gravitas that come off as trite rather than moving. despite prominent examples of stories about slavery, the subject —  along with the broader issue of race —  is still dramatically   and underrepresented in hollywood, leaving plenty of room for more incisive   accounts. in this context, it’s little surprise that the birth of a nation received the premature praise and attention it did. many hollywood studios, critics, and moviegoers looked at the movie and saw a rare and thus seemingly vital project —  one driven by the singular, ambitious artistic vision of black american man. it was hard not to respect the apparent passion behind the film, which was made with much of parker’s own money and with the help of other black actors and writers. together, these factors created astronomically high expectations for the birth of a nation itself. the promise of a groundbreaking work about slavery and a heroic portrayal of a revolt brought to hollywood by a rising black filmmaker was enticing. but hopes for the movie and its creator hit a snag as parker faced scrutiny for his past and criticism for how he handled questions about the rape allegations today. amid growing disappointment with parker’s personal life, emphasis on the film’s importance as new addition to the canon of works about black america has only intensified. though the birth of a nation does little to artistically differentiate itself from its predecessors, it remains a special case of a black person telling a story about black people and, at least at sundance, receiving applause for it. the birth of a nation finds itself in the middle of a national conversation where many who are frustrated with persistent racism and inequality are willing to embrace a tale about the oppressed rising up against their oppressors at any cost. the movie’s reappropriation of the title of one of the most sweeping works of racist propaganda ever created in order to tell the story of a slave uprising is, perhaps, its most clever victory. but for those who’ve said they hoped to view and enjoy the the film in spite of mixed feelings about parker and his past, that may prove difficult. the fact remains, the birth of a nation is a movie that is solely about nat turner, told from turner’s largely fictional perspective. it is envisioned, written, editorialized, and performed by nate parker. ultimately, the movie isn’t sublime nor can it transcend the personal flaws of its creator —  its own failures as a work of cinematic art simply don’t allow it to. whatever importance the birth of a nation does have lies solely in its status as an uncommon film that forces viewers to confront the horrifying and courageous history of black people in america.\n",

      "text:  former nfl star aaron hernandez hangs himself in prison, officials say  (cnn) convicted murderer and former nfl star aaron hernandez was found hanged in his massachusetts prison cell wednesday morning, just days after his acquittal in a double murder case. the    former tight end for the new england patriots hanged himself with a bedsheet attached to a window in his cell at the   correctional center in shirley, the massachusetts department of correction said. his body was discovered at 3:05 a. m. ”lifesaving techniques were attempted on mr. hernandez, and he was transported to umass leominster, where he was pronounced dead at 4:07 a. m.,” the correction department’s statement reads. hernandez, who was serving a life sentence, was alone in his cell in a general population wing and had ”attempted to block his door from the inside by jamming the door with various items,” the statement reads. massachusetts state police are investigating his death. the office of the chief medical examiner is conducting an autopsy to determine the cause and manner of death, the worcester county district attorney’s office said. jose baez, an attorney for hernandez, has been retained by the athlete’s family to investigate the circumstances surrounding his death and will act as the executor of his estate, according to a statement from baez. ”the family and legal team is shocked and surprised at the news of aaron’s death,” baez said in the statement. ”there were no conversations or correspondence from aaron to his family or legal team that would have indicated anything like this was possible. ”aaron was looking forward to an opportunity for a second chance to prove his innocence. those who love and care about him are heartbroken and determined to find the truth surrounding his untimely death.” his death marks one of the most dramatic falls from grace by an athlete in recent memory, and comes the same day that many of his former teammates visit the white house as super bowl champions.  a life sentence for odin lloyd murder, hernandez’s life sentence was for his conviction of   murder in the 2013 killing of odin lloyd, a semipro football player who was dating the sister of hernandez’s fiancée. a jogger found lloyd’s   body in a massachusetts industrial park less than a mile from hernandez’s home on june 17, 2013. hernandez was charged with murder nine days later, and the patriots released him. he was found guilty in april 2015 and sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole. ”this is a shocking and sad end to a very tragic series of events that has negatively impacted a number of families,” said bristol county district attorney thomas quinn, who prosecuted the lloyd case. in may 2014, prosecutors charged hernandez with two murder counts in the july 2012 deaths of safiro furtado and daniel de abreu, two men who were killed in a   shooting outside a boston nightclub. hernandez was found not guilty last friday of two counts of murder in that case, though he was convicted of illegal possession of a firearm. hernandez was visibly emotional when the verdicts were read, embracing his attorneys. ”you could tell that he was relieved as well,” ronald sullivan jr. his defense attorney, said after the verdict. ”he was charged for something somebody else did, and that is a weighty burden for anyone to shoulder.” despite the acquittal, the families of furtado and de abreu still believe hernandez is responsible for their deaths, lawyer william kennedy said. they are considering whether to proceed with a civil case against the estate. the case had been on hold pending the outcome of the criminal case. through a creole translator, furtado’s father, salvatore furtado, said he took no joy in hernandez’s death. but he still wants accountability for the lives of his son and his friend, whom were often reduced to their professions    cleaners    in reports on the trial. ”they were more than cleaners,” kennedy said. ”they were good people who deserved to live and that was robbed from them and the companionship was robbed from their families.” with the acquittal, hernandez’s attorneys had turned their attention toward appealing for a new trial in the lloyd case. as recently as tuesday, baez said he was optimistic about getting that case overturned. ”knowing what i know about aaron, and knowing aaron, there’s a good chance that perhaps we can get that reversed,” the lawyer told cnn then. football career dogged by allegations, hernandez’s arrest cut short what had been a promising football career burgeoning on stardom, beginning in his hometown of bristol, connecticut. from there, he caught passes from tim tebow at the university of florida and was a key contributor to that team’s 2008 national championship. hernandez then became the first gator to win the john mackey award, given annually to the ncaa’s best tight end. but hernandez was dogged by allegations of failed drug tests and was picked by the patriots in the fourth round of the 2010 nfl draft. still, with future hall of famer tom brady throwing to him, hernandez shined for new england. the patriots rewarded him in 2012 with a   contract extension worth up to $40 million. in all, hernandez spent more time in prison than on the field with the patriots.  stacey james, a spokesman for the patriots, said the team was aware of the news but did not anticipate any comment. mike pouncey, a teammate at florida, posted a photo of hernandez on instagram and said they had just talked to each other the day before. ”to my friend my brother! through thick and thin right or wrong we never left each other’s side,” pouncey wrote. ”today my heart hurts as i got the worse news i could have imagined. it was just a day ago we shared our last convo. i will forever miss you and love you bro.” hernandez is survived by his fiancée, shayanna   and their    daughter.  as hernandez waited last week during jury deliberations, he waved and blew kisses to his daughter in the courtroom.\n",

      "text:  when should hacking be legal?    i want to receive updates from partners and sponsors. when aaron swartz, a prominent programmer and digital activist, was arrested in 2011, he was halfway through a fellowship at harvard’s center for ethics. police took him in after he entered a computer closet at mit and downloaded enormous amounts of data from jstor’s extensive database of academic research. swartz was charged with 13 felonies, 11 of them based on the computer fraud and abuse act, or cfaa. some of the charges hinged on violations of jstor’s terms of service, which prohibit bulk, automated downloads that prevent other customers from accessing its documents. faced with the possibility of decades in prison and up to a million dollars in fines, swartz took his own life in 2013. the ordeal brought cfaa —  a      law that has been updated half a dozen times to keep up with new technology —  under intense scrutiny.   activists decried the law for its vague definitions of “unauthorized access” to a computer, and for punishing researchers and academics who analyze and pick apart computer systems they don’t own or operate. some members of congress tried (and then tried again) to roll back elements of the law, including those that have been used to criminalize    violations. but a bill sponsored by representative zoe lofgren and senator ron wyden —  a pair of   democrats —  died in 2013, and is currently stalled after being reintroduced in 2015. the lawmakers named their bill “aaron’s law” after swartz. now, a group of academic researchers and journalists is suing the government, challenging the constitutionality of part of cfaa. with the help of the american civil liberties union, they’re targeting the portion of the law that makes it illegal to break private companies’ terms of service, claiming that the rule violates researchers’ and journalists’ rights to conduct research and investigations in the public interest, as guaranteed by the first amendment. those terms are essentially contracts that users must agree to before receiving an online service like a social network, a retailer’s online catalog, or a specialized search engine. they come in the form of the seemingly endless blocks of lawyerly fine print that pop up as you sign up for a new service —  the ones nearly every user clicks through without reading. but although they’re an individual’s agreement with a company, cfaa makes violating them a federal crime. the four professors bringing the lawsuit are conducting research into racial and other discriminatory biases in online services. one pair of researchers —  christian sandvig, of the university of michigan, and karrie karahalios, of the university of illinois —  is examining   websites, and the other pair —  alan mislove and christo wilson of northeastern university —  is looking at hiring websites. both projects are trying to determine whether the sites serve different search results, listings, and ads to users that appear to be from minority groups. to do so, they’re creating an army of fake profiles and tweaking them to look like they belong to a diverse set of people. but using that tactic —  one that’s very popular among researchers —  could make the professors felons: the terms of most online services, including the largest employment and   websites, prohibit creating multiple profiles, falsifying profile information, and scraping publicly available information with automated scripts. the lawsuit argues that testing for biases is essential to enforcing the fair housing act, which prohibits discrimination in home rentals or sales, and the civil rights act, which bans discrimination in hiring. in the suit, aclu lawyers point out that the government has conducted nationwide undercover testing for illegal biases in housing since the 1970s, and that courts have repeatedly upheld the rights of   testers. they argue that online testing for biases in housing and employment is just as important as older testing models, in which actors of different races would pose as buyers or job candidates and record the responses they receive. online, individuals might not be discriminated against because of a single realtor or hiring manager’s personal bias instead, biases baked into   algorithms can prove harmful to candidates and applicants. even if a person isn’t required to enter their race, gender, or sexual orientation into an online form, there are ways for a website to guess at those details about a person. data brokers create profiles for people based on their online activity, and sell those profiles to companies and organizations. the researchers want to know if a user whose profile indicates she’s black will be served different apartments or jobs than one whose profile indicates he’s white. the lawsuit also includes first look media, the parent company of the intercept, a news site focused on   surveillance, and   reporting. the suit says the publication’s journalists are vulnerable to the same sorts of prosecution for their investigative work as the professors are for their research. as long as attempts to reform cfaa in congress are stalled, challenging the law in court may be the only way to move the needle. if the case sees any success, it could even breathe life back into aaron’s law, or a similar bill. but until the law is changed, researchers who break companies’ terms of service for work have to keep looking over their shoulders for   corporate lawyers —  or federal prosecutors.\n",

      "text:  indian immigrants rethink the american dream  (cnn) srinivas kuchibhotla, shot to death last month in a kansas bar, shared a dream with many other indians i know. his widow described it on facebook a few days after his killing: ”we built our dream home, which he painted, and installed the garage door,” wrote sunayana dumala. ”doing any kind of work on his home gave him immense joy. this was the home that he had built . .. for us and any kids we would have. (it was) our first step to starting our family.  ”it’s so unfortunate that this dream of ours is now shattered.” my heart broke when i read her words.  that was the american dream she was talking about. the ideal that everyone in this country has an equal opportunity to achieve success and prosperity. many indians hail from humble beginnings in their homeland and live by one decree: work hard because in america, you can be what you want to be. my own family shared the dream and when i graduated from college, my father told me to think big. he knew what i had not fully realized yet that as an indian woman, the doors to achievement were wider in this country than in my homeland    and  perhaps anywhere else.  but now, under attack because of their identity, indians see the dream fading. kuchibhotla was a young engineer from hyderabad and came to the united states for a good job. he was having a beer with a friend near his home in olathe when the shooter approached him, told him to ”get out of my country” and gunned him down. a few days later, another indian man, deep rai, was shot outside his home in kent, washington. his attacker yelled: ”go back to your country.” rai is expected to recover. the fbi is investigating both incidents as hate crimes.  the south asian or ”desi” diaspora reacted with obvious horror. what’s been called a  ”wave of   sentiment” has dominated the news in india and added to fear that was already simmering after the 2016 election and rhetoric against immigrants. ”i can tell you a majority of indian parents . .. want their children back in india,” said mithra amaran, who also lives in olathe.  amaran has spent 35 years in the united states. she told me she fears for the lives of her sons, both born and raised in this country. her younger son works in mexico, and amaran feels he is safer in guadalajara than in kansas. ”they are young brown people and i worry about them constantly,” she said. when i went home to kolkata last december, i heard friends and family talk about how happy they were to have returned home. or relieved that a son or daughter had chosen a college in europe or the middle east, instead of america.  author sandip roy, also a native kolkatan, wrote recently in the new york times that indians no longer hold the aspiration of finding success in america. one reason is that india has experienced tremendous economic growth and opened up to the world. but another is a diminished image of the united states. roy mentioned a friend’s cousin’s wedding that was called off because the bride did not want to move with the groom to america. a while ago, i might have read that with utter incredulity. in my youth, a man settled in america was a prized catch. very little else mattered for my girlfriends. life would be set if they could find a husband like that. i hadn’t before heard indians voice these distressing concerns. dumala, in the same facebook post, said it this way: ”do we belong?” she asked. ”is this the same country we dreamed of and is it still secure to raise our families and children here?” sikhs still victims of   hate crimes, a vanishing dream? dumala’s words gave me pause for thought. i hope her question serves as a     call for a community that has not always been totally honest in looking inward.  for too long,   have subscribed to the notion of the ”model minority” immune from racism. as successful entrepreneurs, doctors, lawyers, professors and techies, they live in comfortable   white neighborhoods and focus on getting their kids into harvard and yale. even though the government used to categorize us as ”other,” not all indians saw themselves as such. this, despite the long history of racism and xenophobia in this country that sometimes targeted indians. ”it’s a huge problem,” said journalist and educator rajul punjabi, 32. ”it’s something that’s not talked about at all. now for the first time indians are thinking about race and what black people went through in this country.” socioeconomic status, punjabi told me, can brainwash someone to thinking their skin color does not matter.  another journalist, jennifer chowdhury, 33, told me she has wondered her whole life why indians identify with white people. chowdhury was born to undocumented bangladeshi parents who worked as waiters and housekeepers in new york and were not part of the ”model minority” world. if south asians spoke to each other across class lines, she believes, ”none of this would be such a shock.” marketing professor and blogger gaurav sabnis, 36, added that indians may be guilty themselves of a bit of xenophobia.  ”we don’t like it when we are confused with arabs or people from muslim countries,” he told me. ”we do consider ourselves quasi white.” a lost history of immigration, dark clouds, this is certainly not the first wave of   sentiment in america.  indians began arriving on these shores, primarily in california, in the 19th century, according to the migration policy institute. back then indians were   citizens in their own   country. most who set sail for america were uneducated and unskilled and found jobs working crops and farms. vaishno das bagai was one of them, though he was different from his counterparts. he arrived in san francisco in 1915 with his wife and three young sons, one of the first indians to emigrate with his family. he came because he said he wanted to be free of slavery.  he ran a general store, dressed dapperly in american suits and was naturalized in 1921. but in 1923, the supreme court ruled indians were not white and therefore ineligible for citizenship under the law. bagai had already renounced his british citizenship reapplying would mean certain arrest because of his activism for independence.  bagai became a persona non grata and was subjected to alien laws that, among other things, barred him from owning property. he was forced to sell both his business and his home. the final insult came when, without a passport, he could not visit india. disappointed and humiliated at age 37, bagai gassed himself to death in a san jose hotel room. by then, the immigration acts of 1917 and 1924 had effectively banned asians from entering the united states and virtually ended indian migration.  it wasn’t until president harry truman signed the   bill as part of the immigration act of 1946 that indians could again gain citizenship, own property and vote. the act also established a quota: 100 indians would be allowed into america every year. two decades later, the 1965 immigration act opened the way for indians, including my parents, to settle in america. the act removed   criteria on immigration and put all prospective newcomers on equal footing for access to the united states. in 1960, only 12, 000 indian immigrants lived in this country. today, that number has grown to more than 2. 4 million. and that’s not counting people who arrive with temporary work visas it’s estimated that 70% of the 85, 000 h1b visas handed out annually to highly skilled workers go to indians. nationality, identity and the pledge of allegiance, where ’we all count equally’ the shootings in kansas and washington are dark clouds looming over the dream at the moment.  kuchibhotla’s life was ended by a man who allegedly did not want him here. his widow said that as difficult as it would be for her, she would return to kansas after the funeral to fulfill her husband’s dream. i hope her actions will help other indians to be less fearful.  this week, i thought a lot about the indians who were pioneering immigrants. vaishno das bagai ended his life because he felt he failed at realizing his american dream. he didn’t live to see a place where indians had finally achieved a status other than ”other.” i thought, too, about what we can do to protect the american dream. i sought an answer from bagai’s granddaughter. rani cardona is 61 and identifies as a   girl (her father married a white woman) who was raised in a jewish neighborhood in los angeles and who married a   latino from watts but lived in koreatown.  ”america stood for something once. and we should still stand for it,” she told me.  ”this is the one damn place in the world where we take a stand and say: we all count equally.” she laughed at the idea of the supreme court deciding only white people could be citizens, thinking how much america has progressed since the days when black people had no rights and brown people had few. ”i thought how far we’ve come from being afraid of ’hindoos’ and putting japanese in internment camps,” cardona said. ”our different backgrounds and points of view are indeed our assets. those who seek a life of exclusion, fear differences, or insist on seeing life through a conventional lens of frozen tradition are missing out.” her words resonated. to me, she personifies the immigrant dream. i felt sure her grandfather would be proud.\n",

      "text:  how video changed americans’ views toward the police, from rodney king to alton sterling  another video of a police shooting has once again put attention on racial disparities in the criminal justice system. on tuesday, police shot and killed alton sterling in baton rouge, louisiana. the video shows police pinning sterling down, then shooting him after allegedly seeing a gun.    video has been changing americans’ views toward police for more than 25 years. in 1991, four white los angeles police officers brutally beat rodney king, an unarmed black man, as it was caught on video, sparking local riots and putting a spotlight on longstanding feelings of distrust toward law enforcement in minority communities. the video in particular has been credited with forcing cities to reconcile with  —   and sometimes reform  —   how they police minority neighborhoods. with the rise of the black lives matter movement over the past two years, this issue is once again in the national spotlight. activists have pushed prosecutors across the country to take excessive use of force by police more seriously and, in some cases, file charges against cops. and as gallup found, public confidence in police has generally declined  —   to levels not seen since the rodney king riots.              behind this trend is one critical factor: video. the proliferation of video through smartphones, dashboard cameras, and body cameras  —   and social media’s ability to send a video into viral overdrive  —   has played a major role in holding police accountable, especially this year.    at the very least, video has helped weaken the infallibility that once seemed to surround police  —   a sense that allowed officers’ testimony to be viewed as more credible than testimony of those who lodged complaints against them.    ”before you had complaints, police stories, and witnesses’ stories,” athena mutua, a civil rights scholar at suny buffalo law school, said. but video, paired with its spread on social media, ”was important in getting protesters taken seriously.” in the past couple of years, there were several videos that stood out  —   showing different kinds of use of force that protesters described as excessive and helping expose the racial disparities in america’s criminal justice system.    for instance, an analysis of the available fbi data by vox’s dara lind found black people accounted for 31 percent of police killing victims in 2012, even though they made up just 13 percent of the us population. although the data is incomplete, since it’s based on voluntary reports from police agencies around the country, it highlights the vast disparities in how police use force.            but we’ve known about these statistics for decades. it’s only recently that they got a serious amount of mainstream attention  —   and, as mutua explained, video played an enormous role in getting that attention. here are some of the videos that have stood out in the past few years.    1) freddie gray in baltimore  the video of freddie gray’s arrest in baltimore on april 12, 2015, didn’t reveal much. it showed police carrying the    black man to a police van while he appeared to limp. but it didn’t show police using excessive force or necessarily mistreating gray. instead, it would be gray’s treatment in the police van that would kill him: gray received a fatal spinal cord injury after thrashing around the back of the vehicle without a seat belt, all while his pleas for medical help went ignored. but in baltimore, a city plagued by decades of complaints of police brutality, his fate sparked massive protests and riots against police. still, gray was no anomaly: a september 2014 report by mark puente for the baltimore sun found, for instance, that the city had paid about $5. 7 million in settlements since 2011 to more than 100 people  —   most of whom were black  —   who claimed that officers had beaten them, although police didn’t admit fault in those cases. and critics of baltimore police blamed gray’s death on a practice cops had allegedly used in the past: ”rough rides” in which handcuffed detainees are driven in a reckless manner while they’re not wearing seat belts  —   all to purposely cause injuries. the video helped put a face on these issues. even though no abuse by police was evident in the video, gray’s screams of apparent pain and limping gave the movement the initial credibility it needed to have its complaints against police taken seriously, culminating in criminal charges against the cops involved in gray’s death. 2) walter scott in north charleston, south carolina warning: graphic footage of a police shooting:  on april 4, 2015,    walter scott was unarmed, facing away from the police officer, and haphazardly attempting to flee  —   but that didn’t stop michael slager, a north charleston, south carolina, police officer at the time, from firing his gun at least eight times at the fleeing man, killing him. the video, recorded by a bystander, was monumental in this case. prior to the video’s release, slager claimed that scott had attempted to take his stun gun and use it on him during a struggle before he opened fire. but the video shows no struggle; slager shoots scott to death while scott attempts to flee. and at the end of the video, slager appears to actually pick up the stun gun and plant it near scott’s body.    it was a shooting so outrageous that even conservative defenders of police spoke out against it. fox news’s sean hannity, for one, argued there was no justification for this shooting: ”if he’s not a threat to the officer, or a threat to anybody else, there is never a justification in terms of tactics and techniques and training. there’s no justification for what i see on that video. none.” this was a defining moment for protests of police use of force. up to that point, the events surrounding these cases  —   such as those of michael brown and freddie gray  —   were left largely to interpretation, since there wasn’t a video showing what, exactly, happened. 3) the pool party in mckinney, texas  on june 5, 2015, several teens  —   many of whom were black  —   attended a pool party in suburban mckinney, texas. but pretty soon, police crashed the cookout after receiving reports from locals that the teens were trespassing at the suburban community’s pool. things escalated from there. eric casebolt, a police officer at the time, dashed into the scene  —   screaming, ”move!” and doing what can only be described as a barrel roll  —   before confronting some teens. after a few minutes, casebolt, who was clearly upset and yelling profanities throughout the video, confronted dajerria becton, a      black teen. he then grabbed her and slammed her to the ground, even though she seemed to pose no threat to anyone around her. when some of the girl’s peers confronted him to ask what he was doing, he pulled out a gun, at which point the teens dispersed. after all that, he went back to the girl, and slammed her face to the ground and restrained her.    protesters quickly criticized casebolt for using excessive force  —   and he resigned a few days later. although it’s impossible to say what, exactly, casebolt and other police officers were thinking, the video, even beyond casebolt’s actions, appeared to show police officers specifically targeting black teens in the   crowd. police officers and the general public are more likely to associate black people, even kids, with criminality there’s a potential explanation for this: subconscious prejudices against certain groups of people known as ”implicit bias.” as part of a study published in the journal of personality and social psychology in 2014, researchers studied 176 mostly white, male police officers, and tested them to see if they held an unconscious ”dehumanization bias” against black people by having them match photos of people with photos of big cats or apes. researchers found that officers commonly dehumanized black people, and those who did were most likely to be the ones who had a record of using force on black children in custody. in the same study, researchers interviewed 264 mostly white, female college students and found that they tended to perceive black children age 10 and older as ”significantly less innocent” and older than their white counterparts.    again, it’s impossible to say what was going on in the police officers’ minds. but police officers and the general public are more likely to associate black people, even kids, with criminality. that not only may have led a bunch of white parents to call the police on black teens at a pool, but it may have encouraged police to use far too much force. the video of the police response essentially gave a   example to this problem, which has been widely backed in the empirical research. by showing what seemed like a serious overreaction by parents and police to a pool party, it became much easier to believe that implicit bias is a real, dangerous phenomenon. 4) sandra bland in waller county, texas  the video of sandra bland’s arrest in texas did not show a police officer shooting, killing, or even using force on someone. but what it did reveal is how police officers can sometimes cause situations to escalate entirely unnecessarily. in bland’s case, her arrest for a minor infraction led to her death  —   according to autopsy reports, she killed herself a few days later in a jail cell after officials failed to account for her medical history. on july 10, 2015, a texas trooper, brian encinia, pulled over bland for allegedly failing to signal while changing lanes. the video shows the stop was calm at first, but it escalated once the trooper asked bland to put out a cigarette. bland asked, ”i’m in my car. why do i have to put out my cigarette?” the trooper responded by asking her to get out of the car. when bland didn’t comply, encinia opened her car door and attempted to pull her out. when that didn’t work, encinia pulled out his stun gun, aimed it at bland, and said, ”i will light you up.” at that point, bland got out of the car, and a struggle ensued before encinia arrested her, eventually sending her to the jail where she would die. the entire escalation could have been avoided if the police officer had just let sandra bland keep her cigarette    as i wrote after the video was released, the entire escalation could have been avoided if encinia had just let bland keep her cigarette. it’s hard to see what harm would come to encinia or the public if bland had just been allowed that one refusal. in fact, it might have reduced harm  —   a struggle wouldn’t have taken place, bland wouldn’t have been arrested, and she wouldn’t have died in that jail cell. it’s true that bland could have just obeyed, and the situation might not have escalated. but smoking isn’t illegal, so bland wasn’t violating any laws by smoking in her car. (although, as reason’s jacob sullum pointed out, that may not give bland the legal right to disobey the cop.) but it’s the police officer’s  —   not the civilian’s  —   explicit job to make sure a situation doesn’t escalate. failure to do this was the main complaint of how law enforcement handled the ferguson, missouri, protests after the police shooting of michael brown last august: they consistently used too much force, even against relatively peaceful crowds, causing the situation to spiral into mayhem. the video of bland’s arrest reinforced that narrative, showing that sometimes police officers cause things to escalate when there’s simply no need for it. and it eventually led to encinia’s firing. 5) samuel dubose in cincinnati warning: graphic footage of a police shooting:  on july 19, 2015, a routine traffic stop turned deadly. university of cincinnati police officer ray tensing, who was wearing a body camera, stopped samuel dubose, a    black man, because his car was missing a front license plate. tensing asked dubose for a driver’s license, which the    didn’t have at the time. tensing then asked dubose to take off his seat belt and get out of the car, which dubose didn’t do.    the car then began moving forward very slowly. tensing quickly fired a single shot into the driver’s window, hitting dubose in the head and killing him. the local prosecutor on the case described the shooting in no uncertain terms when he announced murder and voluntary manslaughter charges against tensing. ”this is the most asinine act i’ve ever seen a police officer make,” hamilton county prosecutor joe deters said. ”it’s an absolute tragedy in 2015 that anyone would behave in this manner. it was senseless.” it was a forceful statement from a republican prosecutor who has repeatedly sided with police over the years. but in this case, the video did more than just show an unnecessary shooting  —   like the scott shooting in north charleston, it showed how officers can try to cover up their actions. ”this is the most asinine act i’ve ever seen a police officer make” the incident report filed by university of cincinnati police falsely claimed tensing was dragged by the car, and that he was almost run over by the vehicle. based on the video, though, the timeline of these claims don’t match up. the car started moving very slowly  —   to the point that it’s hard to make out whether it was moving at all. within seconds, tensing reached into the vehicle and shot dubose in the head. tensing then fell over, stumbling a good distance away from the car.    tensing doesn’t appear to be attached to and dragged by the vehicle, and he’s never close to being run over. when he falls over after firing the shot, he’s so far away from the car that he has to run after it as it accelerates. (dubose’s body appears to have fallen against the pedal after he was shot dead, causing the vehicle to accelerate, according to deters.) without the video, it’s much less likely that a grand jury would have agreed to an indictment for murder and voluntary manslaughter, and the prosecutor on the case might not have been so confident that a murder charge was called for. ”there is a tendency to believe an officer over a civilian, in terms of credibility,” david rudovsky, a civil rights lawyer who   prosecuting misconduct: law and litigation, previously told vox’s amanda taub. ”and when an officer is on trial, reasonable doubt has a lot of bite. a prosecutor needs a very strong case before a jury will say that somebody who we generally trust to protect us has so seriously crossed the line as to be subject to a conviction.” the video, then, didn’t just lead to tensing being charged. it also helped show that, just like everyone else, police can be unreliable witnesses  —   especially when they’re the ones facing charges and trial. 6) spring valley high school in columbia, south carolina  on october 26, a school resource officer at spring valley high school in columbia, south carolina, was called into a classroom to deal with a reportedly unruly student. but the student didn’t cooperate, and the situation escalated. the officer, ben fields, told the female student to get up. when she disobeyed, he grabbed her by the neck and tried to pick her up  —   at which point she seemed to try to hit him. the officer then flipped over the student and her desk, and then tossed her to the other side of the room. he then finished the arrest while she lay on the floor.    the officer was fired shortly after the release of the video. but as richland county sheriff leon lott told media, the video raised a question: why are cops involved in disciplining students in the first place? when lawmakers began enacting    policies in the 1970s and ’80s, some of the concepts trickled down to schools, which began outsourcing discipline to police through school resource officers and referrals to the juvenile justice system. the result has been a    pipeline that acts as many kids’ first exposure to the criminal justice system  —   and it can lead to more interactions with the justice system later on, because the lost school time and bad marks on their records can make it much more difficult to get ahead. there’s a lot of research and data that shows black kids are much more likely to be affected by schools’ punitive disciplinary policies:             even after controlling for poverty, a report from the justice policy institute found schools with school resource officers have nearly five times the rate of arrests for disorderly conduct as schools without school resource officers, even though the prevalence of school resource officers in schools has little relationship to reported crime rates. a study published in sociology of education analyzed a data set of more than 60, 000 schools in more than 6, 000 districts. it found that schools with relatively larger minority and poor populations are more likely to implement criminalized disciplinary policies  —   such as suspensions, expulsions, police referrals, and arrests  —   and less likely to medicalize students by, for instance, connecting them to psychological or behavioral care.              although black boys face higher rates of school discipline than anyone else, a report from the center for intersectionality and social policy studies found black girls are six times as likely to be suspended compared with white girls, while black boys are three times as likely to be suspended compared with white boys.  federal investigations have found that black students are punished more harshly than white students in schools even when black and white students engage in identical behavior.  so schools aren’t just more likely to criminalize their students nowadays; they’re more likely to criminalize their black students in particular. some socioeconomic issues  —   black kids are more likely to be poor, and poorer schools tend to be more punitive  —   play a role. but subconscious racial biases play a significant role, as well. the video brought these issue to light, showing that perhaps the best way to discipline students may not be through the use of police officers.    7) laquan mcdonald in chicago  the most recent video to lead to protests against police use of force is actually more than 13 months old. laquan mcdonald didn’t appear to pose a threat to the people around him as he haphazardly ran down a chicago street on october 20, 2014, allegedly carrying a knife but keeping his distance from the police cars parked around him. but police officer jason van dyke nonetheless approached mcdonald from at least 10 feet away and fired 16 shots, even after the black    fell to the ground. after the video was released, the local prosecutor charged van dyke with murder  —   a fact that didn’t stop a successful challenge against prosecutor anita alvarez’s reelection prospects, since many felt she still mishandled this and other instances of police brutality. the us department of justice also announced it will investigate the chicago police department for a pattern and practice of excessive use of force, particularly against racial minorities. the justice department carried out a similar investigation against the ferguson, missouri, police department after the michael brown shooting, finding a pattern of racial bias in that department’s policing. but the investigation into the chicago police department is the largest the justice department has ever taken against a city, the huffington post’s ryan reilly reported. this makes the justice department’s investigation potentially groundbreaking, since it shows even some of the biggest police departments in the us aren’t above accountability. but, as with the other cases on this list, it may not have been possible without the video and the public outcry it caused. the latest: alton sterling in baton rouge, louisiana  according to the advocate, baton rouge police officers responded to a call at a convenience store around 12:35 am tuesday after receiving an anonymous tip that a man in a red shirt who was selling cds had pointed a gun at someone. alton sterling, a    black man, matched part of the description: he sold cds, and he was wearing a red shirt.    a short cellphone video captured by a bystander shows what happened next: two police officers yelled at sterling to get on the ground. the officers then pulled him to the ground, pinning him on his back. an officer yelled, ”he’s got a gun!” the video shows an officer holding down sterling’s left arm, but sterling’s right arm isn’t visible. one officer aimed his gun at sterling’s chest  —   at what seems to be   range. within seconds, at least one officer opened fire. sterling was pronounced dead shortly after. shop owner abdullah muflahi told the advocate that the officers were ”aggressive” from the start shop owner abdullah muflahi told the advocate that the officers were ”aggressive” from the start, and that sterling was armed but was not holding his gun and didn’t have his hand near his pocket at the time of the shooting. both officers are on administrative leave, per baton rouge police department policy, and an investigation is underway. both officers were reportedly wearing body cameras, and the police car had a dashboard camera as well. as several media outlets reported, sterling had a criminal record. but his previous convictions aren’t relevant to the shooting; it’s whether he was holding and trying to use a gun on the officers at the time he was shot. the legal standard for use of force requires officers to reasonably perceive a threat at the moment of use of force. since sterling was seemingly immobile in the video of the shooting, critics argue that he was not in fact a threat and the shooting is another example of excessive use of force against a black man.    \n",
      "how video changed americans’ views toward the police, from rodney king to alton sterling  another video of a police shooting has once again put attention on racial disparities in the criminal justice system\n",
      "on tuesday, police shot and killed alton sterling in baton rouge, louisiana\n",
      "the video shows police pinning sterling down, then shooting him after allegedly seeing a gun\n",
      "   video has been changing americans’ views toward police for more than 25 years\n",
      "in 1991, four white los angeles police officers brutally beat rodney king, an unarmed black man, as it was caught on video, sparking local riots and putting a spotlight on longstanding feelings of distrust toward law enforcement in minority communities\n",
      "the video in particular has been credited with forcing cities to reconcile with  —   and sometimes reform  —   how they police minority neighborhoods\n",
      "with the rise of the black lives matter movement over the past two years, this issue is once again in the national spotlight\n",
      "activists have pushed prosecutors across the country to take excessive use of force by police more seriously and, in some cases, file charges against cops\n",
      "and as gallup found, public confidence in police has generally declined  —   to levels not seen since the rodney king riots\n",
      "             behind this trend is one critical factor: video\n",
      "the proliferation of video through smartphones, dashboard cameras, and body cameras  —   and social media’s ability to send a video into viral overdrive  —   has played a major role in holding police accountable, especially this year\n",
      "   at the very least, video has helped weaken the infallibility that once seemed to surround police  —   a sense that allowed officers’ testimony to be viewed as more credible than testimony of those who lodged complaints against them\n",
      "   ”before you had complaints, police stories, and witnesses’ stories,” athena mutua, a civil rights scholar at suny buffalo law school, said\n",
      "but video, paired with its spread on social media, ”was important in getting protesters taken seriously.” in the past couple of years, there were several videos that stood out  —   showing different kinds of use of force that protesters described as excessive and helping expose the racial disparities in america’s criminal justice system\n",
      "   for instance, an analysis of the available fbi data by vox’s dara lind found black people accounted for 31 percent of police killing victims in 2012, even though they made up just 13 percent of the us population\n",
      "although the data is incomplete, since it’s based on voluntary reports from police agencies around the country, it highlights the vast disparities in how police use force\n",
      "           but we’ve known about these statistics for decades\n",
      "it’s only recently that they got a serious amount of mainstream attention  —   and, as mutua explained, video played an enormous role in getting that attention\n",
      "here are some of the videos that have stood out in the past few years\n",
      "   1) freddie gray in baltimore  the video of freddie gray’s arrest in baltimore on april 12, 2015, didn’t reveal much\n",
      "it showed police carrying the    black man to a police van while he appeared to limp\n",
      "but it didn’t show police using excessive force or necessarily mistreating gray\n",
      "instead, it would be gray’s treatment in the police van that would kill him: gray received a fatal spinal cord injury after thrashing around the back of the vehicle without a seat belt, all while his pleas for medical help went ignored\n",
      "but in baltimore, a city plagued by decades of complaints of police brutality, his fate sparked massive protests and riots against police\n",
      "still, gray was no anomaly: a september 2014 report by mark puente for the baltimore sun found, for instance, that the city had paid about $5\n",
      "7 million in settlements since 2011 to more than 100 people  —   most of whom were black  —   who claimed that officers had beaten them, although police didn’t admit fault in those cases\n",
      "and critics of baltimore police blamed gray’s death on a practice cops had allegedly used in the past: ”rough rides” in which handcuffed detainees are driven in a reckless manner while they’re not wearing seat belts  —   all to purposely cause injuries\n",
      "the video helped put a face on these issues\n",
      "even though no abuse by police was evident in the video, gray’s screams of apparent pain and limping gave the movement the initial credibility it needed to have its complaints against police taken seriously, culminating in criminal charges against the cops involved in gray’s death\n",
      "2) walter scott in north charleston, south carolina warning: graphic footage of a police shooting:  on april 4, 2015,    walter scott was unarmed, facing away from the police officer, and haphazardly attempting to flee  —   but that didn’t stop michael slager, a north charleston, south carolina, police officer at the time, from firing his gun at least eight times at the fleeing man, killing him\n",
      "the video, recorded by a bystander, was monumental in this case\n",
      "prior to the video’s release, slager claimed that scott had attempted to take his stun gun and use it on him during a struggle before he opened fire\n",
      "but the video shows no struggle; slager shoots scott to death while scott attempts to flee\n",
      "and at the end of the video, slager appears to actually pick up the stun gun and plant it near scott’s body\n",
      "   it was a shooting so outrageous that even conservative defenders of police spoke out against it\n",
      "fox news’s sean hannity, for one, argued there was no justification for this shooting: ”if he’s not a threat to the officer, or a threat to anybody else, there is never a justification in terms of tactics and techniques and training\n",
      "there’s no justification for what i see on that video\n",
      "none.” this was a defining moment for protests of police use of force\n",
      "up to that point, the events surrounding these cases  —   such as those of michael brown and freddie gray  —   were left largely to interpretation, since there wasn’t a video showing what, exactly, happened\n",
      "3) the pool party in mckinney, texas  on june 5, 2015, several teens  —   many of whom were black  —   attended a pool party in suburban mckinney, texas\n",
      "but pretty soon, police crashed the cookout after receiving reports from locals that the teens were trespassing at the suburban community’s pool\n",
      "things escalated from there\n",
      "eric casebolt, a police officer at the time, dashed into the scene  —   screaming, ”move!” and doing what can only be described as a barrel roll  —   before confronting some teens\n",
      "after a few minutes, casebolt, who was clearly upset and yelling profanities throughout the video, confronted dajerria becton, a      black teen\n",
      "he then grabbed her and slammed her to the ground, even though she seemed to pose no threat to anyone around her\n",
      "when some of the girl’s peers confronted him to ask what he was doing, he pulled out a gun, at which point the teens dispersed\n",
      "after all that, he went back to the girl, and slammed her face to the ground and restrained her\n",
      "   protesters quickly criticized casebolt for using excessive force  —   and he resigned a few days later\n",
      "although it’s impossible to say what, exactly, casebolt and other police officers were thinking, the video, even beyond casebolt’s actions, appeared to show police officers specifically targeting black teens in the   crowd\n",
      "police officers and the general public are more likely to associate black people, even kids, with criminality there’s a potential explanation for this: subconscious prejudices against certain groups of people known as ”implicit bias.” as part of a study published in the journal of personality and social psychology in 2014, researchers studied 176 mostly white, male police officers, and tested them to see if they held an unconscious ”dehumanization bias” against black people by having them match photos of people with photos of big cats or apes\n",
      "researchers found that officers commonly dehumanized black people, and those who did were most likely to be the ones who had a record of using force on black children in custody\n",
      "in the same study, researchers interviewed 264 mostly white, female college students and found that they tended to perceive black children age 10 and older as ”significantly less innocent” and older than their white counterparts\n",
      "   again, it’s impossible to say what was going on in the police officers’ minds\n",
      "but police officers and the general public are more likely to associate black people, even kids, with criminality\n",
      "that not only may have led a bunch of white parents to call the police on black teens at a pool, but it may have encouraged police to use far too much force\n",
      "the video of the police response essentially gave a   example to this problem, which has been widely backed in the empirical research\n",
      "by showing what seemed like a serious overreaction by parents and police to a pool party, it became much easier to believe that implicit bias is a real, dangerous phenomenon\n",
      "4) sandra bland in waller county, texas  the video of sandra bland’s arrest in texas did not show a police officer shooting, killing, or even using force on someone\n",
      "but what it did reveal is how police officers can sometimes cause situations to escalate entirely unnecessarily\n",
      "in bland’s case, her arrest for a minor infraction led to her death  —   according to autopsy reports, she killed herself a few days later in a jail cell after officials failed to account for her medical history\n",
      "on july 10, 2015, a texas trooper, brian encinia, pulled over bland for allegedly failing to signal while changing lanes\n",
      "the video shows the stop was calm at first, but it escalated once the trooper asked bland to put out a cigarette\n",
      "bland asked, ”i’m in my car\n",
      "why do i have to put out my cigarette?” the trooper responded by asking her to get out of the car\n",
      "when bland didn’t comply, encinia opened her car door and attempted to pull her out\n",
      "when that didn’t work, encinia pulled out his stun gun, aimed it at bland, and said, ”i will light you up.” at that point, bland got out of the car, and a struggle ensued before encinia arrested her, eventually sending her to the jail where she would die\n",
      "the entire escalation could have been avoided if the police officer had just let sandra bland keep her cigarette    as i wrote after the video was released, the entire escalation could have been avoided if encinia had just let bland keep her cigarette\n",
      "it’s hard to see what harm would come to encinia or the public if bland had just been allowed that one refusal\n",
      "in fact, it might have reduced harm  —   a struggle wouldn’t have taken place, bland wouldn’t have been arrested, and she wouldn’t have died in that jail cell\n",
      "it’s true that bland could have just obeyed, and the situation might not have escalated\n",
      "but smoking isn’t illegal, so bland wasn’t violating any laws by smoking in her car\n",

      "text:  sins of the father: daughters of men who killed for argentina’s regime speak out “do you think i’m a monster?” her father’s question was one that analía kalinec had been struggling to avoid since childhood. but as she confronted him in the prison where he was held under trial for some of the worst crimes in argentina’s history, it was one she could no longer ignore. “not as my father,” analía told him. but to herself she thought: “regarding everything else, yes, you are a monster. ” analía, a    psychologist, didn’t realize at first the implication of that brief exchange in 2009. “i got home and told my husband my father and i had really connected. it wasn’t until later that i realized my life had just changed forever. ” her father, eduardo kalinec, is a former police officer who was known as “doctor k” at the three death camps where he committed heinous human rights abuses during argentina’s brutal military dictatorship between 1976 and 1983. it’s not clear how he earned the nickname. “the torture rooms were called surgeries. maybe that’s why they nicknamed him doctor,” said analía. about 2, 000 people are believed to have died in those three camps, of an estimated total of 30, 000 killed by the military. kalinec was given a life sentence in 2010 on five counts of murder and 147 counts of abduction followed by torture. his trial was part of   historical reckoning, in which around 700 other former officers have received similar sentences. over the past year and a half, however, that reckoning has once again been challenged by sympathisers with the former regime. since coming to power in december 2015, the   government of president mauricio macri has started lending a friendly ear to relatives of convicted officers lobbying for their release. in their meetings with government officials, these lobbyists portray convicted human rights abusers as “political prisoners” and unrecognized heroes of a “war against subversion” during the 1970s and 80s.  disturbed by the growing normalization of such opinions, analía and the daughters of other men who kidnapped, tortured and killed for the dictatorship have decided to speak out. “we have chosen to face the truth, no matter how painful it is,” said analía.  sitting with her in an interview with the guardian are two other daughters from her group: liliana furió, 54, a   and    lawyer erika lederer. all three have been ostracized by their own families for denouncing their own fathers, but they hope that by going public they can encourage other perpetrators to break the “pact of silence” over their crimes. liliana’s father, paulino furió, is an    former army intelligence officer serving a life sentence under house arrest. liliana repeatedly begged her father to reveal the secret locations where the military buried their victims. “now it’s impossible because he’s developed senile dementia,” she said. but the last time she pleaded with him to divulge the grave sites, his response was chilling: “god has forgiven me. i don’t regret anything,” he said. “what’s the point of their silence? everything’s already proven. there are relatives waiting to bury their dead, grandmothers looking for their grandchildren,” liliana pleads. perhaps the cruelest secret kept by the   criminals is the fate of the babies born in captivity to mothers who were later murdered by the regime. it is estimated that about 500 such infants were given to military families to raise as their own. so far, only 122 have been reunited with their biological families. for all three woman, it was a supreme court decision early last month that brought matters to a head. based on a legal technicality, the justices ruled that dictatorship torturers were eligible for early release, kalinec among them.  “i couldn’t stop crying over the injustice of releasing someone like my father, despite how much i love him” says analía. “he’s exactly where he should be. ” a massive response from society, including protest marches across the country, quickly forced congress to pass an overnight law neutralizing the supreme court ruling on may 10. for now, 350 dictatorship perpetrators who would have been set free by the ruling remain behind bars, but erika lederer’s father is now beyond justice. lieutenant ricardo lederer was an obstetrician at the campo de mayo military base outside buenos aires, where it is estimated 5, 000 people were slaughtered. according to court testimony, lederer, inspired by   eugenics, intended to “improve the race” through his work. young female captives were kept alive at his “maternity clinic” until they gave birth, only to be murdered shortly afterwards. the babies were given to military families to be raised, and many only discovered their true identities decades later. in 2012, a man named pablo gaona miranda found out through dna testing that he was the son of a couple murdered by the dictatorship. lederer had signed gaona miranda’s birth certificate in 1978, falsely stating he was the son of a military couple. cornered by his past, lederer killed himself. “my father never showed any repentance,” says erika. emboldened by the public reaction against last month’s supreme court’s decision, erika penned a striking facebook post last month: “the children of perpetrators who never approved their crimes, who shouted ‘murderer’ to their faces, should unite. ” all three women grew up under the violent shadow of their fathers’ crimes. alarmed at the discovery of her father’s past, erika submitted to a dna test to see if she herself could be the child of missing people. the test, however, turned out negative. “i had to accept i was his daughter. ” liliana remembers frequent beatings from her father. “these guardians of order were the paradigm of misogynist, patriarchal machismo. they not only tortured women, they raped them and then appropriated their children. they’re the serpent’s egg. ” the three women made contact after erika’s facebook post, and have bonded over their shared history. other children of perpetrators have come forward since, encouraged by their facebook page, disobedient stories. “until now we were misfits  —   we felt fear and shame having to reveal who we were,” says liliana. their main hope is that their coming out will inspire at least some of the hundreds of convicted perpetrators to provide information. “my father is only 65 years old, completely lucid, very intelligent and he has a prodigious memory,” says analía. analía has not spoken to eduardo kalinec since that prison visit eight years ago, when she could not bring herself to call him a monster to his face. her last contact was a letter urging him to speak. “i hold out my hand and wait for you on the other side of the street,” analía wrote.\n",

      "text:  two bishops hid sex abuse of hundreds of children: grand jury altoona, pa.  —   two roman catholic bishops who led a central pennsylvania diocese helped cover up the sexual abuse of hundreds of children by over 50 priests or religious leaders over a   period, according to a grand jury report issued tuesday. the   report on sexual abuse in the   diocese was based partly on evidence from a secret diocesan archive uncovered through a search warrant executed in august, said pennsylvania attorney general kathleen kane, who announced the findings. “these predators desecrated a sacred trust and preyed upon their victims in the very places where they should have felt most safe,” kane said in a statement. “just as troubling is the   perpetrated by clergy leaders that allowed this abuse to continue for decades. ” no criminal charges are being filed in the case because some abusers have died, the statute of limitations has expired and, in some cases, victims are too traumatized to testify, she said. the report is especially critical of bishops james hogan and joseph adamec. hogan, who headed the diocese from 1966 to 1986, died in 2005. adamec, who succeeded him, retired in 2011. adamec cited possible   in refusing to testify before the grand jury in november. but in a court filing, his attorney said the accusations against the retired    bishop are unfounded. adamec required 14 priests accused under his watch to undergo psychiatric evaluation, the filing said. nine of them were suspended or removed from ministry, and the five who were reinstated never   his attorney wrote. “bishop adamec’s handling of abuse allegations has no similarity to other clergy abuse scandals,” his attorney wrote. this is the current bishop, mark bartchak, is not accused of any wrongdoing. he recently suspended a handful of priests named as alleged abusers in the report, though the grand jury said it remains “concerned the purge of predators is taking too long. ” the clergy sex abuse crisis erupted in 2002, when the boston globe persuaded a judge to unseal files from the boston archdiocese in the case of a pedophile priest who had been transferred by bishops from parish to parish without warning parents or civil authorities. the scandal then spread nationwide and beyond, as catholics and others demanded to know the full scope of wrongdoing by abusers and the bishops who kept them working with children. since then, dioceses across the country have been forced to release thousands of internal files on accused priests. the   report said hogan covered up abuse allegations by transferring offending priests, including by sending one accused clergyman to a school for boys. the church’s own records show that priest “would have been prosecuted and convicted except that the bishop intervened and he was sent to michigan for treatment and then placed in another parish upon his return,” the grand jury found. one diocesan official under hogan, monsignor philip saylor, told the grand jury that church officials held such sway in the   diocese that “the police and civil authorities would often defer to the diocese” when priests were accused of abuse, the report said. saylor told the grand jury that the mayors of altoona and johnstown even consulted him on their choices for police chief in the 1980s. “politicians of blair county were afraid of monsignor saylor, and he apparently persuaded the mayor to appoint me as the chief of police,” altoona’s former police chief peter starr testified. the report contends adamec or his staff threatened some alleged abuse victims with excommunication, and generally worked harder to hide or settle allegations of abuse than to sanction the priests accused of committing them. the report said the bishop created a “  chart” to help guide how much victims would receive from the church. victims fondled over their clothes were to be paid $10, 000 to $25, 000; fondled under their clothes or subjected to masturbation, $15, 000 to $40, 000; subjected to forced oral sex, $25, 000 to $75, 000; subjected to forced sodomy or intercourse, $50, 000 to $175, 000. the u. s. conference of catholic bishops estimates that american dioceses have paid nearly $4 billion since 1950 to settle claims with victims. the investigation began when kane’s office was asked to review the handling of abuse allegations at bishop mccort catholic high school against an athletic trainer, franciscan brother stephen baker, who worked there from 1992 to 2001. baker killed himself in 2013 after abuse settlements with an ohio diocese where he formerly worked were publicized. that investigation continues.\n",

      "text:   this is what it’s actually like to live in a surveillance state  petra epperlein had forgotten what she was doing on october 7, 1989, but the photograph showed it plain as day. “i almost fainted,” she said, as she looked at the picture, watchful and taken from a distance, of herself in her twenties and her father among a crowd of observers looking at the protest below. the image had been taken by the secret police in the final days of the east german dictatorship, as part of their notoriously invasive mass surveillance program. epperlein stumbled upon the photo while investigating a family secret: shortly after the berlin wall came down and germany was reunified, her father received anonymous letters accusing him of being an informant for the ministry of state security, or stasi. after her father committed suicide in 1999, epperlein wanted to know if the accusation was true, and if it contributed to her father’s decision to kill himself. the investigation is the subject of a new documentary, karl marx city. the film takes its name from the city where epperlein was born. back when germany was divided in two and the german democratic republic in the east was ruled by a communist dictatorship, karl marx city was an industrial center of the   ‘dictatorship of the proletariat.’ after reunification, the city returned to its   name, chemnitz, and most signs of the communist regime were erased. “there is no continuity in the life of east germans,” said epperlein. “when germany talks about its history, the east german part plays a very, very tiny part” in the official narrative. karl marx city follows epperlein’s effort to uncover the truth about her family and to understand a world that has literally been erased from the map. surveillance was “the essential element of life,” epperlein told buzzfeed news in an interview. “everybody had a good childhood. i had loving parents and friends,” but she was careful to draw a distinction. “my personal experience is disconnected from the harshness of what went on. ” the documentary explores this paradox through the stasi’s own surveillance footage. at face value, the images are unremarkable, almost boring  —   men, women, and children going about their    existence. but they reveal obsessive and pervasive spying. “you always had a feeling it existed, but you never really knew what was going on,” said epperlein, recalling her childhood. it was this uncertainty that gave the stasi their power. the question of how many people worked for the stasi is still unclear. an employee at the stasi archive told buzzfeed news that “there is no simple answer. ” however, documents show that by 1988 there were tens of thousands of stasi employees and nearly 200, 000 documented informants. that amounts to roughly one spy per 60 citizens, and research suggests that the numbers were much higher, with many more undocumented “information providers” who spied on their coworkers, classmates, neighbors, or friends. you could never be sure if you were speaking in confidence, and for decades it effectively silenced political discussion. if you had something to say, “you would go for a long walk in the woods,” said epperlein, now in her 50s. stasi oppression was “very sophisticated,” pointed out michael tucker, epperlein’s   and husband. “it’s not necessarily the oppression of violence, it’s so subtle, it’s so in everything. ” epperlein agreed. for her, “one thing that surveillance achieved back then and achieves now is it erodes trust. ” in the film, epperlein’s mother christa discusses the possibility that her husband had been an informant and says, “i’m a little afraid  …    if you learn that someone who you trusted did something. that’s difficult. that’s why i always thought, rather not know. ” the specter of pervasive surveillance opened up even the most intimate relationships to suspicion. while christa hid from dark questions about her husband, epperlein distrusted her father. “everything is possible and you never know what was really going on,” she recalled. “we were kids and you never really know your parents. i was pretty much ready for everything. ” the product of that surveillance is now archived and available to the public through records requests. there have been more than 7 million such inquiries since 1991. out of the shadows and subject to careful oversight, the records are oddly quaint  —   analog and organized by an extensive card catalog. on microfiche, one of the archivists observes in the film, the images of envelopes intercepted and opened by the stasi look like miniature houses. the records are so extensive, however, that the materials, including photographs, video and audio recordings, and 41 million index cards would stretch 68 miles, roughly equivalent to the width of new jersey. “one of the interesting things is how much of the information they collected was complete nonsense,” tucker observed. “there’s a certain madness in it. how much can you collect before it’s ridiculous?” it took four years for epperlein to receive her father’s records. ultimately, the records show that epperlein’s father was not an informant. in fact, the file reveals the stasi had regarded his political views as suspicious and that his boss had reported on his activities, along with details about the family life. “this is bitter,” epperlein’s mother says in the film. it’s “an invasion of privacy at a level i did not expect,” epperlein said in the interview. while the file doesn’t answer the question of why epperlein’s father decided to kill himself, knowing that he was not an informant has given the family closure. when epperlein finds the picture of the protest in the film, the narrator observes that stasi surveillance shows her father as the man she always knew him to be. “it kept a record of my life for me,” she told buzzfeed news. of course, she also pointed out, “it comes back to trust. ” in the   since the wall came down, it has become commonplace for many people to share intimate details of their lives on social media. reflecting on our current environment, tucker said, “we don’t have any barriers on privacy anymore, we all want attention, that’s how we get our status. ” “people trust their information not to be used against them,” said epperlein. “is it justified to be that trusting? i don’t know, i’m not on facebook. ”  \n",

      "text:   meet the maserati-driving deadhead lawyer who stands between hackers and prison  the law offices of jay leiderman occupy the third floor of a beige building in an unlovely office park across a busy road from a strip mall that features a martial arts studio, a discount tool mart, and a vape shop called “vapes!” here in ventura, california  —   known variously as “ventucky,” “bakersfield by the sea,” and, per one urban dictionary entry, “the armpit between santa barbara and malibu”  —   the locals tend to get charged with crimes like driving under the influence, simple assault, and possession of methamphetamine. it is not exactly a hotbed of hacking, making it a bit of a strange location for an attorney who may be the   defender of people accused of computer crimes in the united states. and yet here comes jay leiderman, pulling into a   parking lot in a   maserati ghibli. over the past five years, leiderman has turned himself into one of the central figures in the small world of lawyers who regularly defend hackers. if the justice department indicted you tomorrow for doing something on a computer that you shouldn’t have been doing, it’s almost certain that within a few short hours you would hear leiderman’s name. that might be because he’s already written about your case to his thousands of followers online. it might be because your lawyers need advice themselves. or it might be because leiderman is already your lawyer. the thing is, the justice department doesn’t prosecute many people under the computer fraud and abuse act, the federal statute that governs computer crimes involving “unauthorized access. ” the people it does come after are usually young and unable to afford   representation. consequently, even america’s most prominent defenders of computer criminals don’t defend them all the time, or even most of the time. and when they do, they often work for free, or close. that means, in 2016, it isn’t possible to have a solvent criminal law business solely devoted to defending hackers. and so the vast majority of people who trickle into leiderman’s practice have nothing to do with the cfaa. most of them probably have no idea what the cfaa is, or that their criminal defense attorney has an international reputation defending people accused of violating it. neither, for that matter, do many of leiderman’s local colleagues. no, one of computer law’s loudest voices  —   the attorney who has represented some of the country’s most famous hackers and who keeps an encrypted chat app open at all times so he can dispense ad hoc pro bono legal advice to members of anonymous  —   spends much of his time defending the kinds of clients matlock might turn down on a good day and keeping ventura’s marijuana professionals out of trouble. most days, he can’t even have an irl conversation about his biggest cases. which is a shame, because jay leiderman really loves to talk. one such local client: michael bogdan, who arrived at the office unannounced on a recent monday morning. he walked through reception  —   past a legal assistant, past twin charcoal portraits of the imprisoned hacker jeremy hammond and journalist barrett brown, past a framed copy of a ventura county star feature identifying leiderman as “one of the top attorneys in the country for people accused of violating the federal computer fraud and abuse act,” past several framed pieces of grateful dead album art  —   and into the corner office. leiderman, having paused a bootleg 1978 live performance of the rolling stones’ “some girls,” spun in his chair to face his client, a   white man with a dead tooth. “you’re here?” leiderman said. “you’re here!” bogdan had been calling all morning about a hearing in his case, which was typical of leiderman’s often bizarre workload. the    movie memorabilia dealer had slowly been going blind since 2004 and had recently started paying porn stars for sex, or, as leiderman put it, “enjoying his sight while he’s still got it. ” last year, after a relationship with one such escort soured  —   she claims he was harassing her on social media, while he claims to have become enraged after she asked him to pay her to exchange text messages  —   she took out a restraining order against him that included his writing online. bogdan hired leiderman to get that part of the order lifted as a prior restraint on speech. now leiderman was trying to work out a deal with her lawyer that would keep them away from each other while still letting bogdan write about their relationship on his own website, the porn star and the blind man. “it’s always something!” leiderman said, laughing as he located, with clairvoyant speed, a piece of paper buried on hisanarchic desk. bogdan’s was just one of 26 open cases for leiderman as of early april other clients included a man accused of drunkenly stealing a dirt bike from the pit of a motocross rally, a teenager who shot up his own house with his father’s gun to distract his parents from the fact that he had missed his curfew, a hell’s angel with a gun charge, a man accused of molesting a    and assorted drunken misdemeanors. also among them were a handful of court appearances he was making on behalf of a friend and former officemate who had not totally unexpectedly killed himself the week before. and then there was the case of matthew keys, the former reuters social media editor who had been convicted the previous october of conspiring to hack the website of the los angeles times and who faced up to 87 months in prison. his sentencing hearing loomed in two weeks in federal court in sacramento. if leiderman, who is 45, was exhausted or grieving, he didn’t show it. for one thing, such was the slew of tasks at hand that he had taken up coffee just that week, and he was on his second cup of the day. (“i don’t drink coffee!” he said, over a steaming mug, as if he had surprised himself.) for another, his two most salient features, extremely blue eyes and extremely shrewd eyebrows, in combination with his cherubic face, gave leiderman the aspect of a man perpetually on the verge of a wonderful prank. also, this was a   day, so he dressed all the way down: a black     with the image of a roaring tiger, stonewashed jeans with   knees, and adidas sambas. “most people coming in here are having the worst day of their life,” leiderman said. “they don’t need some stuffy asshole with gray hair who is dead inside. ” whatever the reason for the getup, it was most definitely a vibe. here was an utterly local lawyer costumed as a forgotten john hughes protagonist driving an expensive italian sports car presiding over an exuberantly disordered office who was possibly repressing some   mourning who, by the way, had some pretty deep connections with ventura county’s medicinal cannabis community who lived basically a double life as counsel to the internet’s undesirables all the while a bitter john with too much time on his hands hovered weirdly over his desk. there was a slight but unmistakably zany whiff of saul goodman in the air. it was more than enough to make one wonder: how had this guy become the face of criminal defense for hackers in america? and, relatedly: how was this guy going to keep matthew keys out of prison? “every monday something always fucking happens!” leiderman exclaimed, in response to something on his phone, though he did not seem to be complaining. on march 18, 2013, a monday, jay leiderman went on huffpost live to discuss his newest client, matthew keys. keys had been indicted the previous thursday by the u. s. government, which alleged that he had passed login credentials to members of anonymous in an internet chat and encouraged members of the hacking collective to deface websites owned by the tribune company, his former employer, against which he had a grudge. according to the indictment, an anonymous member named “sharpie” had used that information, at keys’ bidding, to change the headline of a los angeles times article to “pressure builds in house to elect chippy 1337,” a reference to a hacking group. the defacement was live for about 40 minutes. in the dazed hours after the indictment, keys received an email from tor ekeland, probably america’s other   cfaa defense attorney, whose client, the hacker andrew “weev” auernheimer, told him to take the case. but ekeland wasn’t licensed in california, so he had to find someone to take the case with him, pro bono. his first thought was jay leiderman, whom he knew by reputation. (it helps when you are only one of a few lawyers who does what you do.) in leiderman, ekeland found a “  trial lawyer” who was “extraordinarily quick on his feet. ” on huffpost live, leiderman had a lot to say about matthew keys. if his client had wanted to get back at his former employer, he would be facing less jail time if he had “beat him with a baseball bat” and “  all the computers and walls of the los angeles times,” and so didn’t you have to ask yourself, “is our government incentivizing physical violence?” also, if his client had even been in that internet chat, he had been there as “sort of an     thing. ” also, come on, what his client had been accused of doing was totally not that big of a deal. “no one was hurt, there were no lasting injuries, no one’s identity was stolen, lives weren’t ruined,” leiderman had told the associated press. “it was a joke, and i guess a joke will get you 25 years in prison. ” leiderman was far from alone in making this argument. the cfaa, introduced in 1984 and expanded in 1986, is widely loathed among internet activists, security researchers, and many lawyers in the field, who see the law as an “egregiously overbroad” relic that has led to a chilling effect on legitimate work, and that protects the rights of powerful corporations and government agencies while endangering ordinary web users. in particular, the central phrases in the law, which forbid “unauthorized access” of a “protected computer,” can be interpreted so widely as to include behavior as mundane as password sharing. worse still, the law carries exorbitant statutory maximum sentences keys was looking at a maximum prison term of 25 years. that’s partially because the cfaa is subject to the “economic offenses” subsection of the federal sentencing guidelines, which adds “offense levels” in proportion to the monetary loss incurred by the crime. in a forthcoming paper in the george washington university law review, the computer law scholar orin kerr argues that cfaa offenses should be considered crimes of trespass, not fraud, and that loss should be a secondary factor in calculating sentences. the law professor and media scholar tim wu has called the cfaa “the worst law in technology. ” the january before keys was indicted, aaron swartz, a    programmer and activist, hanged himself in his brooklyn apartment in the face of 35 years in prison. he had been indicted in 2011 under the cfaa after downloading millions of articles from jstor, an archive of academic journals. even before his death, swartz was an internet folk hero: he   reddit and   rss. his alleged crimes were   or at least principled  —   he had long been an advocate for democratizing access to information. swartz’s indictment had given   advocates a powerful symbol of the way the law can crush good people and good work his suicide robbed them of a plaintiff who could have helped make a profound case against the law in court. the   aaron’s law act, named for swartz, has been introduced in congress twice but has never come up for a vote. among the reasons why cfaa reform has moved so slowly may be the fact that the mandatory maximums, while alarming, are almost never applied, and that there simply are not very many cfaa prosecutions, full stop. according to kerr, the federal government brings about 100 cfaa prosecutions a year. that’s because cfaa violations are extraordinarily difficult to find and prove. indeed, the government tends to prosecute cfaa cases only when it has a strong chance of securing a conviction, as it did against keys, who had confessed to the crime in a taped interview with an fbi agent  —   a confession keys said he gave while whacked out on prescription pills. this puts attorneys like leiderman in a strange situation: how can you argue simultaneously that your client is innocent and that taking your client to court for the    thing that your client     did is wild prosecutorial overreach? the government offered keys a plea deal, which, according to keys, did not rule out the possibility of a short prison sentence. he rejected it. that meant it was up to leiderman and ekeland to take apart the government’s case that keys did it. and failing that, to take apart the law that made what he     did a crime. though everyone in jay leiderman’s family told him he should be a lawyer, it took jerry garcia to truly convince him. born in queens in 1971 to a toy executive and a   teacher, leiderman grew up in    rockland county, about an hour’s drive north of the city. the highlights of his early childhood revolved around a yearly trip with his father to toy fair, the annual industry convention, which he left one year with a box full of star wars figurines and another year with a photo beside lee majors, the six million dollar man. (that one sits on a bookshelf in his office.) in high school, he nursed two obsessions, both musical: punk rock and the grateful dead. that meant dozens of shows at cbgb in the   to late 1980s. it also meant, after the dead burst through to a new generation of ears on the strength of 1987’s “touch of grey,” the beginning of a lifelong fandom. “i’ve seen them, i would guess, exactly 164 times,” leiderman said. after graduating michigan in 1993, leiderman and his friends loaded up a “roadworthy” blue volvo station wagon with camping equipment and set out to follow the group across the country,  . there they joined thousands of other deadheads hawking everything from burritos and blown glass to nitrous oxide and   to fund their travel. a friend made frequent trips to nepal, where he bought and brought back   that the group flipped for an $8 profit on every shirt. outside shows, leiderman would stand on a blue tarp, shirtless, wearing denim cutoffs, a fanny pack, and birkenstocks, with dozens of the shirts spread out before him. the group made enough money to live and travel, staying 12 people in a hotel room. the ride lasted for two blissful years. along the way, leiderman soaked up the group’s  ’60s ethos of personal and political freedom. “we were so on our own. we weren’t bound by any conventional rules. we felt that we were america’s last tribe,” he said. then, on august 9, 1995, jerry garcia died of a heart attack in his room at the serenity knolls treatment center. the dead disbanded. the organizing force of leiderman’s life was suddenly gone. “my whole life changed,” leiderman said. “everyone i knew, all my friends, were all in flux. were we going to scatter to the four winds? ultimately, people did. ” but leiderman remembered something his grandfather had told him: if he wanted to turn his idealistic streak into social change, he had to work from inside the system. plus, his parents had always told him that he would make a good lawyer. plus, “i didn’t know what the hell i was doing,” leiderman said. so, the weekend after garcia died, leiderman began his law school applications. he showed up for classes at the university of san francisco law school the following summer with hair halfway down his back, and left in 1999 as the class president. he applied to public defender jobs around the country, and picked ventura because of the weather. he thought he’d stay 10 months. every day after court closes, many of the men and women who make their living in the ventura county hall of justice proceed to the victoria pub and grill, where they gossip, laugh, bitch, play darts, and drink. victoria’s is dark, big, and cheap: a good bar. it is also stumbling distance from leiderman’s office. he has been coming here for 16 years, ever since he started working as a lawyer. on that recent monday, now in the   leiderman was joined at victoria’s by a group of his friends, all of whom had worked together as young lawyers at the ventura county public defender’s office. they had a table that was “their table. ” they had drinks that were “the usual. ” the mood at the bar was initially somber nearly everyone there had been at the funeral of leiderman’s friend the day before. eventually, after a round, the talk turned to the group’s early days as lawyers. in his first week on the job, leiderman was assigned the case of a homeless man who had been charged with stealing a shopping cart. when he reviewed the facts, he discovered that the shopping cart came from a store that had been closed for 30 years. leiderman filed a barrage of pretrial motions, and the judge threw the case out. “on to bigger and better things,” leiderman told his boss, the chief deputy public defender, afterward. “wait a minute,” his boss had responded. “you will go on to bigger things, but you may never do a better one. ” the case left an impression on leiderman. he saw just how disproportionately and arbitrarily governments could prosecute their weakest subjects. he also saw that thorough, competent lawyering could make a   difference to powerless people accused of crimes. within a year at the vcpdo, leiderman had graduated from misdemeanors to murders and   cases. he sought out a series of cases defending the homeless, successfully challenging an   law that was frequently used to round up ventura’s large indigent population and getting a raft of misdemeanor illegal camping charges  —   also used as a weapon against the homeless  —   thrown out so decisively it led to an internal city review. “it pissed me off, it was a horrific injustice, and it was the right thing to do,” leiderman said. leiderman’s years at the vcpdo coincided with the passage of california’s medical marijuana statute, and the young lawyer started taking possession for sales and illegal cultivation cases. by the time he opened a private practice, in 2007, leiderman had become something of an expert in state and county compliance laws. in addition to defending clients from   criminal charges, leiderman also advises medical marijuana collectives, teaching them the law, writing up their contracts and articles of association, and waiting on retainer for   with the police. it’s a major chunk of his business. though leiderman no longer tokes  —   it makes him too paranoid  —   he sees this work as directly related to his cfaa practice. “it’s another way the government is invading our life unnecessarily,” he said. “this is a plant that has been used medicinally for 5, 000 years. that we know of. ” in 2008, leiderman started dating justine avtjoglou, also a public defender. (“aside from my wife, i am the best lawyer in my house,” reads leiderman’s facebook biography, in part.) on president’s day in 2011, they discovered that avtjoglou was pregnant. they married that friday, on the upper level of victoria’s. now the leidermans live in a large stucco house in the ventura hills with their son lydon, named for johnny rotten. in the garage next to his maserati  —   leased, according to leiderman, with some of his fee for securing a reduced sentence for andrew luster, heir to the max factor cosmetics fortune, who had been serving 124 years for drugging and raping three women  —   sat racks and racks of bootleg live rock and reggae cds. a huge green anonymous flag hung over the car. if he has any qualms about making maserati money off of representing a convicted rapist, leiderman doesn’t show it. when it comes to taking what he calls “the ugly cases”  —   the andrew lusters, the child molesters, the     teenagers  —   leiderman is very much a defense attorney’s defense attorney. “it is my duty under the constitution to represent these clients,” he wrote in an email. he has even, with some acrobatics, figured out a way to fold these cases into his civil libertarian worldview. “i am what stands between the police state and the tyranny of ever encroaching government. if we abandon the ugliest of the cases, before we know it we’re back to sending people to prison for a joint. ” in the fall of 2010, leiderman, like many americans, started reading about anonymous, the hacktivist collective that brought down the websites of paypal, mastercard, and visa in retaliation for cutting off service to wikileaks. it was a heady time for the organization, which experienced a run of successes between the paypal hack, the hack of the security tech firm hbgary, a distributed denial of service, or ddos, of the westboro baptist church, and activity in support of the arab spring. “there was invincibility in the air,” leiderman said. “they were so far ahead of the fbi. back then they didn’t have allies  —   they had fans. ” fascinated by the group, and buoyed by his success with medical marijuana, leiderman realized that there would be litigation against its members. in the spring of 2011, while avtjoglou was pregnant with lydon, leiderman tweeted that he would represent “righteous hacktivists” pro bono. one of the responses came from christopher doyon, also known as commander x, or the “homeless hacker. ” a member of anonymous, doyon in 2010 allegedly launched a ddos attack against the santa cruz county website as retaliation for the breakup of a protest against a law forbidding overnight camping. the law was widely seen as a measure of controlling the homeless population. doyon, who feared arrest, started meeting leiderman in secret. leiderman did his part, instructing his office to refer to doyon only as “thomas paine” over the phone. in doyon, leiderman had found a client who shared his love of the grateful dead. but more than that, he had found a client who wasn’t just a hacker but also a liberal activist, someone sticking up for a free tribe, someone who helped him continue to draw the connection between the ideals of his counterculture past and legal present. today leiderman sees hackers as part of a grand narrative of american counterculture  —   at least the parts of it with good music. “the grateful dead is counterculture based on the idea of changing the world through conversation and education,” he said. “punk is like, you know, fuck you, we’re going to change the world through being loud and in your face and forcing you to see the ugly. hackers are like, fuck you, man, we can change the world because we can beat you at your own game. ” his experiences with doyon familiarized leiderman not just with the basics of the cfaa but also with that   side effect of participation in the activist counterculture: a healthy sense of paranoia. in september 2011, leiderman and doyon exchanged emails about a forthcoming meeting at a mountain view coffee shop. as he drove there, leiderman got a phone call from his office: his client had been arrested. “i can’t prove anything, but you know,” he said, “i’m sure the fbi are in my computer somewhere. ” after doyon’s bail and subsequent flight to canada, leiderman, never a technophile, got serious about security. anons showed him how to set up encrypted chat and email. and he began to keep up a constant conversation, via wickr, with members of the group, which continues to this day. he also became involved in a passel of other hacking cases. he consulted on the plea deal for jeremy hammond, who hacked the private security firm stratfor. he helped manage the defense fund for deric lostutter (aka kyanonymous) the hacker who doxxed the high school football players in the 2012 steubenville, ohio, rape case. he pleaded the lulzsec hacker raynaldo “royal” rivera down from a maximum of 15 years in prison for hacking sony to a year and a day. he helped on the defense of one the “fappening” hackers. and he consulted on dozens of other cases. along the way, he became an expert, sought out for television hits and newspaper quotes. “jay understands the subculture of anonymous and computer hackers better than any attorney,” matthew keys said. “he has an encyclopedic knowledge of this culture. he gets it. ” leiderman claims not to have any advertising  —   that universal sign of the sleazy defense attorney  —   and it’s true that there are no roadside billboards in southern california bearing his face. but he has figured out a remarkably effective, if   way of keeping his name out there: a relentless internet presence. on twitter, facebook, and his professional blog, all of which he updates constantly, leiderman posts news, legal analysis, musings, and the odd meme related to his cases. the relative paucity of cfaa cases enables attorneys who have litigated one or two to market themselves as experts. five years since he first became involved with the world of hacking, leiderman has, between trials, settlements, and consultations, worked on about 50. that allows him to claim, if not mastery, ubiquity. yet through it all, he’s remained a fixture in ventura. after a few rounds at victoria’s, a district attorney with a powerhouse of a mustache sidled up to leiderman, who was between him and the dart board. they exchanged pleasantries. leiderman said that life was good, thanks, and that he’d be heading up to sacramento soon to work on one of those crazy hacking cases he had a practice in. “huh,” said the da. “i had no idea. ” in january 2014, leiderman and tor ekeland filed a motion to suppress matthew keys’ taped confession. the attorneys claimed that keys’ statement was inadmissible because he was disoriented from a combination of sleeping pills and a new antidepressant when he waived his miranda rights. in may, u. s. district judge kimberly mueller denied the motion. the inclusion of the confession put the defense at an enormous disadvantage in the trial, which started last september, more than four years after the alleged crimes. in the tape, keys says, “i did it,” and admits to being aescracked, the user who chat logs show gave out login credentials with the instruction to “go fuck some shit up. ” it’s damning. the confession allowed the government to tell keys’ story as a “bitter, expensive, exhausting tale of online anonymous revenge against a media organization,” as assistant u. s. attorney paul hemesath put it in his closing. the defense attorneys didn’t put on a case. they didn’t call any witnesses. they didn’t try to establish an alibi or a thorough alternative narrative for the crimes. instead, they tried, at every turn, to slow down and frustrate the government’s introduction of evidence and claims about loss. the government called witness after witness from the tribune company to recount an elaborate corporate response to the breach. at the end of each witness’s testimony, the prosecution asked them to estimate how many hours they spent working on the hack, information the government then used, based on salary, to calculate loss. most of the 10 witnesses made more than $100, 000 annually. the defense went to work attacking the loss figures. leiderman harped on the fact that the prosecution’s witnesses all recorded their time in “very tidy hour,   increments” that were “unreliable   …     the essence of reasonable doubt. ” leiderman and ekeland also made repeated reference to an email sent by keys’ former supervisor to a tribune attorney reading, “by the way, if you bill $1000 an hour, that would help us get this prosecuted” it was a reference to the $5, 000 figure the government needed to reach to justify bringing a felony charge. the supervisor claimed on the stand that the email was a joke. if the jury had a hard time deciphering the truth about the loss figures, it also had to contend with the law itself. the cfaa is an extraordinarily complicated and technical statute, and after congratulating the jury for staying awake through the trial, leiderman spent much of his closing simplifying. he again attacked the government’s loss calculations. and in the face of his client’s confession, leiderman turned to a   commonsense argument about the nature of the prosecution itself. “this is not exactly the most unforgettable act of hacktivism ever there was, but here we’re in a federal case,” leiderman said. “and i don’t know if you know the expression ‘don’t make a federal case out of it.’ my grandpa always used to say that to me, and now i say it to you. ” in the end, the government’s evidence was too strong. after a day of deliberations, the jury found keys guilty of all three counts. if leiderman was going to keep his client out of jail, he would have to convince the judge. the april morning of the sentencing hearing was warm and clear. justice had a good view: from the 14th floor of the federal courthouse that towers opaquely over downtown sacramento,   windows look out for miles over the city and the sacramento river to the west. the members of the prosecution team, led by matthew segal, the chief of the special prosecutions unit for the eastern district of california, had arrived early and were sitting on spectator benches with big white spiral binders balanced on their knees. minutes before the hearing was set to start, there was no sign of keys or his lawyers. “has anyone seen jay or tor?” segal asked. finally, the double doors of the courtroom swung open and leiderman, ekeland, and keys walked through. keys had let his brown hair grow long since the trial he looked like a slightly morose samwise gamgee. in contrast, leiderman faintly buzzed. wearing a gray windowpane armani suit and a gray tie with an ornate yellow pattern, his curly hair slicked back, he mingled with local television reporters. he fiddled with his laptop. he joked with segal. “i don’t get nervous before a hearing,” leiderman said. “i stand in the shower talking to myself. by the time i get out, i’m calm as shit. ” he was feeling optimistic. in the weeks leading up to sentencing, leiderman had become convinced that they were “in the hunt for a halfway house and an extreme load of community service”: that is, no jail time. he had pulled all kinds of comps  —   comparable cases from which to argue for sentencing uniformity  —   and found what he felt were far worse crimes that had been punished with very little or no incarceration. he had written most of an epic,   sentencing memo, during which time he had “barely eaten or slept for days. ” the memo argued  …    well, it argued everything. keys had been in anonymous’s ironically titled #internetfeds chatroom for journalistic reasons indeed, keys’ entire life was dedicated to the noble calling of journalism. segal himself had said keys’ actions were “not the crime of the century. ” in 2010, when the hack took place, keys may have been “swept up in a world marked by a groupthink of hacking madness. ” “sharpie,” the hacker who actually changed the los angeles times article, hadn’t been charged with a crime. previous “digital intrusions” on tribune company media, including the infamous 1987 max headroom tv signal hack, had been treated as silly pranks. keys didn’t think the login credentials would work. the cfaa was “using horse and buggy laws to handle a jet plane society. ” it was splatter painting as criminal defense. by contrast, the government wrote a concise   memo. it gave credit to leiderman and ekeland as “excellent attorneys” and recommended a   prison sentence, down from the “reasonable” 87 months recommended in a sealed   report written by two u. s. probation officers. the tribune company had submitted a loss figure at trial of nearly $1 million, which had been cut in the   report to a   $249, 956. meanwhile, the number that the government proved at trial was a fraction of that, $13, 000. early in the sentencing, judge mueller ruled that she would accept only the trial figure. the decision halved the sentencing range, with no statutory minimum. it appeared all the work leiderman and ekeland had done attacking the loss figures at trial had paid off. leiderman looked ecstatic. the low loss figure had changed the feeling in the courtroom. when segal reiterated what the prosecution had said at trial  —   “this wasn’t mischief this was a rage driven by profound narcissism”  —   there was a note of pleading in his voice. as he spoke, leiderman hovered three feet away, hands clasped behind his back, staring benignly. he appeared to be somehow supervising the u. s. attorney. and then leiderman had the floor. as he had in his memo, he bundled as many arguments into his time as possible. in his high   rasp, he pointed out that keys hadn’t broken any laws before or since his indictment. prosecutions such as this one had caused a lack of public trust in the government. why had keys been prosecuted? was it because he was a journalist? everyone shares passwords. the law was applied too inconsistently the punishments didn’t fit the crimes. leiderman leaned forward, toward the judge, and his appeal grew personal. keys had a bad childhood. and there would be some poetry in house arrest. “his grandmother was a prison guard for many years   …     what better situation is there than having grandma there as an   guard?” leiderman said. judge mueller, normally   smiled broadly. finally, the defense attorney implored the judge to see keys, and anonymous, and hackers, in context, as part of the lava flow of technological change that is inherently countercultural, progress that the government inhibits only at a   cost. he pulled out his iphone and gestured to it. “if steve jobs and steve wozniak had been phone phreaking with a blue box today,” leiderman said, “they would have been prosecuted under the cfaa. ” the last argument, about the government stifling human progress, went too far. matthew keys may have been prosecuted under an unjust law, but he was by no means a sympathetic defendant, and his crimes were neither ones of conscience or   significance. indeed, the juxtaposition between leiderman’s sweeping rhetoric and his petty and unlikable client laid bare a simple fact: opponents of the cfaa have yet to find their edie windsor, an unimpeachably righteous figure who comes to symbolize the harm done to innocent citizens by a bad, antiquated law. or rather they did find that person, and he killed himself. eventually, though, there will be another aaron swartz. there will be another person accused of violating the cfaa for whom an ideological argument compels people beyond the sphere of privacy experts and hackers, a person whose life and circumstances make the intellectual case against the law morally urgent. perhaps jay leiderman will even be in the courtroom when that happens. it didn’t happen in the courtroom in sacramento. in her sentencing remarks, judge mueller turned one of leiderman’s arguments against his client, admonishing keys for abusing his position to harm the press he claimed to love. “i have no doubt keys does understand the power of words and the notion that we take our debates public,” she said. “we fight words with words we play fair. ” she sentenced him to two years in prison and two years of probation. outside the courtroom, immediately following the sentence, leiderman was uncharacteristically glum. “we walked in today facing an   sentence and we walked out with 24. i suppose we should be heartened by that. but i’m not. ” though leiderman and ekeland had been saying for months that the case would be settled at appeal, and keys would likely remain free pending that appeal, the day had briefly raised the possibility that their client wouldn’t serve time. “jay took it really hard,” keys said a few days later. “he was really disappointed. he was, out of all of us, the most disappointed by it. ” there was a rushed press conference in the sunny plaza in front of the federal building. keys had to drive his grandmother, his only family member who came to the hearing, the 45 minutes back to her home outside the city she napped in the afternoons. leiderman had a flight to catch back to ventura in an hour  —   there had been some unexpected chicanery in the case of the blind man and the porn star. but in front of the cameras, he seemed to have regained his good spirits. somewhere from the   of photographers and journalists who surrounded the men came a question for the attorney: how had he ever gotten matthew keys’ sentence reduced from a potential seven years to only 24 months? leiderman paused, considered. “i’m an excellent lawyer!” he said, and grinned.•   \n",

      "“you’re here!” bogdan had been calling all morning about a hearing in his case, which was typical of leiderman’s often bizarre workload\n",
      "the    movie memorabilia dealer had slowly been going blind since 2004 and had recently started paying porn stars for sex, or, as leiderman put it, “enjoying his sight while he’s still got it\n",
      "” last year, after a relationship with one such escort soured  —   she claims he was harassing her on social media, while he claims to have become enraged after she asked him to pay her to exchange text messages  —   she took out a restraining order against him that included his writing online\n",
      "bogdan hired leiderman to get that part of the order lifted as a prior restraint on speech\n",
      "now leiderman was trying to work out a deal with her lawyer that would keep them away from each other while still letting bogdan write about their relationship on his own website, the porn star and the blind man\n",
      "“it’s always something!” leiderman said, laughing as he located, with clairvoyant speed, a piece of paper buried on hisanarchic desk\n",
      "bogdan’s was just one of 26 open cases for leiderman as of early april other clients included a man accused of drunkenly stealing a dirt bike from the pit of a motocross rally, a teenager who shot up his own house with his father’s gun to distract his parents from the fact that he had missed his curfew, a hell’s angel with a gun charge, a man accused of molesting a    and assorted drunken misdemeanors\n",
      "also among them were a handful of court appearances he was making on behalf of a friend and former officemate who had not totally unexpectedly killed himself the week before\n",
      "and then there was the case of matthew keys, the former reuters social media editor who had been convicted the previous october of conspiring to hack the website of the los angeles times and who faced up to 87 months in prison\n",
      "his sentencing hearing loomed in two weeks in federal court in sacramento\n",
      "if leiderman, who is 45, was exhausted or grieving, he didn’t show it\n",
      "for one thing, such was the slew of tasks at hand that he had taken up coffee just that week, and he was on his second cup of the day\n",
      "(“i don’t drink coffee!” he said, over a steaming mug, as if he had surprised himself.) for another, his two most salient features, extremely blue eyes and extremely shrewd eyebrows, in combination with his cherubic face, gave leiderman the aspect of a man perpetually on the verge of a wonderful prank\n",
      "also, this was a   day, so he dressed all the way down: a black     with the image of a roaring tiger, stonewashed jeans with   knees, and adidas sambas\n",
      "“most people coming in here are having the worst day of their life,” leiderman said\n",
      "“they don’t need some stuffy asshole with gray hair who is dead inside\n",
      "” whatever the reason for the getup, it was most definitely a vibe\n",
      "here was an utterly local lawyer costumed as a forgotten john hughes protagonist driving an expensive italian sports car presiding over an exuberantly disordered office who was possibly repressing some   mourning who, by the way, had some pretty deep connections with ventura county’s medicinal cannabis community who lived basically a double life as counsel to the internet’s undesirables all the while a bitter john with too much time on his hands hovered weirdly over his desk\n",
      "there was a slight but unmistakably zany whiff of saul goodman in the air\n",
      "it was more than enough to make one wonder: how had this guy become the face of criminal defense for hackers in america? and, relatedly: how was this guy going to keep matthew keys out of prison? “every monday something always fucking happens!” leiderman exclaimed, in response to something on his phone, though he did not seem to be complaining\n",
      "on march 18, 2013, a monday, jay leiderman went on huffpost live to discuss his newest client, matthew keys\n",
      "keys had been indicted the previous thursday by the u\n",
      "s\n",
      "government, which alleged that he had passed login credentials to members of anonymous in an internet chat and encouraged members of the hacking collective to deface websites owned by the tribune company, his former employer, against which he had a grudge\n",
      "according to the indictment, an anonymous member named “sharpie” had used that information, at keys’ bidding, to change the headline of a los angeles times article to “pressure builds in house to elect chippy 1337,” a reference to a hacking group\n",
      "the defacement was live for about 40 minutes\n",
      "in the dazed hours after the indictment, keys received an email from tor ekeland, probably america’s other   cfaa defense attorney, whose client, the hacker andrew “weev” auernheimer, told him to take the case\n",
      "but ekeland wasn’t licensed in california, so he had to find someone to take the case with him, pro bono\n",
      "his first thought was jay leiderman, whom he knew by reputation\n",
      "(it helps when you are only one of a few lawyers who does what you do.) in leiderman, ekeland found a “  trial lawyer” who was “extraordinarily quick on his feet\n",
      "” on huffpost live, leiderman had a lot to say about matthew keys\n",
      "if his client had wanted to get back at his former employer, he would be facing less jail time if he had “beat him with a baseball bat” and “  all the computers and walls of the los angeles times,” and so didn’t you have to ask yourself, “is our government incentivizing physical violence?” also, if his client had even been in that internet chat, he had been there as “sort of an     thing\n",
      "” also, come on, what his client had been accused of doing was totally not that big of a deal\n",
      "“no one was hurt, there were no lasting injuries, no one’s identity was stolen, lives weren’t ruined,” leiderman had told the associated press\n",
      "“it was a joke, and i guess a joke will get you 25 years in prison\n",
      "” leiderman was far from alone in making this argument\n",
      "the cfaa, introduced in 1984 and expanded in 1986, is widely loathed among internet activists, security researchers, and many lawyers in the field, who see the law as an “egregiously overbroad” relic that has led to a chilling effect on legitimate work, and that protects the rights of powerful corporations and government agencies while endangering ordinary web users\n",
      "in particular, the central phrases in the law, which forbid “unauthorized access” of a “protected computer,” can be interpreted so widely as to include behavior as mundane as password sharing\n",
      "worse still, the law carries exorbitant statutory maximum sentences keys was looking at a maximum prison term of 25 years\n",
      "that’s partially because the cfaa is subject to the “economic offenses” subsection of the federal sentencing guidelines, which adds “offense levels” in proportion to the monetary loss incurred by the crime\n",
      "in a forthcoming paper in the george washington university law review, the computer law scholar orin kerr argues that cfaa offenses should be considered crimes of trespass, not fraud, and that loss should be a secondary factor in calculating sentences\n",
      "the law professor and media scholar tim wu has called the cfaa “the worst law in technology\n",
      "” the january before keys was indicted, aaron swartz, a    programmer and activist, hanged himself in his brooklyn apartment in the face of 35 years in prison\n",
      "he had been indicted in 2011 under the cfaa after downloading millions of articles from jstor, an archive of academic journals\n",
      "even before his death, swartz was an internet folk hero: he   reddit and   rss\n",
      "his alleged crimes were   or at least principled  —   he had long been an advocate for democratizing access to information\n",
      "swartz’s indictment had given   advocates a powerful symbol of the way the law can crush good people and good work his suicide robbed them of a plaintiff who could have helped make a profound case against the law in court\n",
      "the   aaron’s law act, named for swartz, has been introduced in congress twice but has never come up for a vote\n",
      "among the reasons why cfaa reform has moved so slowly may be the fact that the mandatory maximums, while alarming, are almost never applied, and that there simply are not very many cfaa prosecutions, full stop\n",
      "according to kerr, the federal government brings about 100 cfaa prosecutions a year\n",
      "that’s because cfaa violations are extraordinarily difficult to find and prove\n",
      "indeed, the government tends to prosecute cfaa cases only when it has a strong chance of securing a conviction, as it did against keys, who had confessed to the crime in a taped interview with an fbi agent  —   a confession keys said he gave while whacked out on prescription pills\n",
      "this puts attorneys like leiderman in a strange situation: how can you argue simultaneously that your client is innocent and that taking your client to court for the    thing that your client     did is wild prosecutorial overreach? the government offered keys a plea deal, which, according to keys, did not rule out the possibility of a short prison sentence\n",
      "he rejected it\n",
      "that meant it was up to leiderman and ekeland to take apart the government’s case that keys did it\n",
      "and failing that, to take apart the law that made what he     did a crime\n",
      "though everyone in jay leiderman’s family told him he should be a lawyer, it took jerry garcia to truly convince him\n",
      "born in queens in 1971 to a toy executive and a   teacher, leiderman grew up in    rockland county, about an hour’s drive north of the city\n",
      "the highlights of his early childhood revolved around a yearly trip with his father to toy fair, the annual industry convention, which he left one year with a box full of star wars figurines and another year with a photo beside lee majors, the six million dollar man\n",
      "(that one sits on a bookshelf in his office.) in high school, he nursed two obsessions, both musical: punk rock and the grateful dead\n",
      "that meant dozens of shows at cbgb in the   to late 1980s\n",
      "it also meant, after the dead burst through to a new generation of ears on the strength of 1987’s “touch of grey,” the beginning of a lifelong fandom\n",
      "“i’ve seen them, i would guess, exactly 164 times,” leiderman said\n",
      "after graduating michigan in 1993, leiderman and his friends loaded up a “roadworthy” blue volvo station wagon with camping equipment and set out to follow the group across the country,  \n",
      "there they joined thousands of other deadheads hawking everything from burritos and blown glass to nitrous oxide and   to fund their travel\n",
      "a friend made frequent trips to nepal, where he bought and brought back   that the group flipped for an $8 profit on every shirt\n",
      "outside shows, leiderman would stand on a blue tarp, shirtless, wearing denim cutoffs, a fanny pack, and birkenstocks, with dozens of the shirts spread out before him\n",
      "the group made enough money to live and travel, staying 12 people in a hotel room\n",
      "the ride lasted for two blissful years\n",
      "along the way, leiderman soaked up the group’s  ’60s ethos of personal and political freedom\n",
      "“we were so on our own\n",
      "we weren’t bound by any conventional rules\n",
      "we felt that we were america’s last tribe,” he said\n",
      "then, on august 9, 1995, jerry garcia died of a heart attack in his room at the serenity knolls treatment center\n",
      "the dead disbanded\n",
      "the organizing force of leiderman’s life was suddenly gone\n",
      "“my whole life changed,” leiderman said\n",
      "“everyone i knew, all my friends, were all in flux\n",
      "were we going to scatter to the four winds? ultimately, people did\n",
      "” but leiderman remembered something his grandfather had told him: if he wanted to turn his idealistic streak into social change, he had to work from inside the system\n",
      "plus, his parents had always told him that he would make a good lawyer\n",
      "plus, “i didn’t know what the hell i was doing,” leiderman said\n",
      "so, the weekend after garcia died, leiderman began his law school applications\n",
      "he showed up for classes at the university of san francisco law school the following summer with hair halfway down his back, and left in 1999 as the class president\n",
      "he applied to public defender jobs around the country, and picked ventura because of the weather\n",
      "he thought he’d stay 10 months\n",
      "every day after court closes, many of the men and women who make their living in the ventura county hall of justice proceed to the victoria pub and grill, where they gossip, laugh, bitch, play darts, and drink\n",
      "victoria’s is dark, big, and cheap: a good bar\n",
      "it is also stumbling distance from leiderman’s office\n",
      "he has been coming here for 16 years, ever since he started working as a lawyer\n",
      "on that recent monday, now in the   leiderman was joined at victoria’s by a group of his friends, all of whom had worked together as young lawyers at the ventura county public defender’s office\n",
      "they had a table that was “their table\n",
      "” they had drinks that were “the usual\n",
      "” the mood at the bar was initially somber nearly everyone there had been at the funeral of leiderman’s friend the day before\n",
      "eventually, after a round, the talk turned to the group’s early days as lawyers\n",
      "in his first week on the job, leiderman was assigned the case of a homeless man who had been charged with stealing a shopping cart\n",
      "when he reviewed the facts, he discovered that the shopping cart came from a store that had been closed for 30 years\n",
      "leiderman filed a barrage of pretrial motions, and the judge threw the case out\n",
      "“on to bigger and better things,” leiderman told his boss, the chief deputy public defender, afterward\n",
      "“wait a minute,” his boss had responded\n",
      "“you will go on to bigger things, but you may never do a better one\n",
      "” the case left an impression on leiderman\n",
      "he saw just how disproportionately and arbitrarily governments could prosecute their weakest subjects\n",
      "he also saw that thorough, competent lawyering could make a   difference to powerless people accused of crimes\n",
      "within a year at the vcpdo, leiderman had graduated from misdemeanors to murders and   cases\n",
      "he sought out a series of cases defending the homeless, successfully challenging an   law that was frequently used to round up ventura’s large indigent population and getting a raft of misdemeanor illegal camping charges  —   also used as a weapon against the homeless  —   thrown out so decisively it led to an internal city review\n",
      "“it pissed me off, it was a horrific injustice, and it was the right thing to do,” leiderman said\n",
      "leiderman’s years at the vcpdo coincided with the passage of california’s medical marijuana statute, and the young lawyer started taking possession for sales and illegal cultivation cases\n",
      "by the time he opened a private practice, in 2007, leiderman had become something of an expert in state and county compliance laws\n",
      "in addition to defending clients from   criminal charges, leiderman also advises medical marijuana collectives, teaching them the law, writing up their contracts and articles of association, and waiting on retainer for   with the police\n",
      "it’s a major chunk of his business\n",
      "though leiderman no longer tokes  —   it makes him too paranoid  —   he sees this work as directly related to his cfaa practice\n",
      "“it’s another way the government is invading our life unnecessarily,” he said\n",
      "“this is a plant that has been used medicinally for 5, 000 years\n",
      "that we know of\n",
      "” in 2008, leiderman started dating justine avtjoglou, also a public defender\n",
      "(“aside from my wife, i am the best lawyer in my house,” reads leiderman’s facebook biography, in part.) on president’s day in 2011, they discovered that avtjoglou was pregnant\n",
      "they married that friday, on the upper level of victoria’s\n",
      "now the leidermans live in a large stucco house in the ventura hills with their son lydon, named for johnny rotten\n",
      "in the garage next to his maserati  —   leased, according to leiderman, with some of his fee for securing a reduced sentence for andrew luster, heir to the max factor cosmetics fortune, who had been serving 124 years for drugging and raping three women  —   sat racks and racks of bootleg live rock and reggae cds\n",
      "a huge green anonymous flag hung over the car\n",
      "if he has any qualms about making maserati money off of representing a convicted rapist, leiderman doesn’t show it\n",
      "when it comes to taking what he calls “the ugly cases”  —   the andrew lusters, the child molesters, the     teenagers  —   leiderman is very much a defense attorney’s defense attorney\n",
      "“it is my duty under the constitution to represent these clients,” he wrote in an email\n",
      "he has even, with some acrobatics, figured out a way to fold these cases into his civil libertarian worldview\n",
      "“i am what stands between the police state and the tyranny of ever encroaching government\n",
      "if we abandon the ugliest of the cases, before we know it we’re back to sending people to prison for a joint\n",
      "” in the fall of 2010, leiderman, like many americans, started reading about anonymous, the hacktivist collective that brought down the websites of paypal, mastercard, and visa in retaliation for cutting off service to wikileaks\n",
      "it was a heady time for the organization, which experienced a run of successes between the paypal hack, the hack of the security tech firm hbgary, a distributed denial of service, or ddos, of the westboro baptist church, and activity in support of the arab spring\n",
      "“there was invincibility in the air,” leiderman said\n",
      "“they were so far ahead of the fbi\n",
      "back then they didn’t have allies  —   they had fans\n",
      "” fascinated by the group, and buoyed by his success with medical marijuana, leiderman realized that there would be litigation against its members\n",
      "in the spring of 2011, while avtjoglou was pregnant with lydon, leiderman tweeted that he would represent “righteous hacktivists” pro bono\n",
      "one of the responses came from christopher doyon, also known as commander x, or the “homeless hacker\n",
      "” a member of anonymous, doyon in 2010 allegedly launched a ddos attack against the santa cruz county website as retaliation for the breakup of a protest against a law forbidding overnight camping\n",
      "the law was widely seen as a measure of controlling the homeless population\n",
      "doyon, who feared arrest, started meeting leiderman in secret\n",
      "leiderman did his part, instructing his office to refer to doyon only as “thomas paine” over the phone\n",
      "in doyon, leiderman had found a client who shared his love of the grateful dead\n",
      "but more than that, he had found a client who wasn’t just a hacker but also a liberal activist, someone sticking up for a free tribe, someone who helped him continue to draw the connection between the ideals of his counterculture past and legal present\n",
      "today leiderman sees hackers as part of a grand narrative of american counterculture  —   at least the parts of it with good music\n",
      "“the grateful dead is counterculture based on the idea of changing the world through conversation and education,” he said\n",
      "“punk is like, you know, fuck you, we’re going to change the world through being loud and in your face and forcing you to see the ugly\n",
      "hackers are like, fuck you, man, we can change the world because we can beat you at your own game\n",
      "” his experiences with doyon familiarized leiderman not just with the basics of the cfaa but also with that   side effect of participation in the activist counterculture: a healthy sense of paranoia\n",
      "in september 2011, leiderman and doyon exchanged emails about a forthcoming meeting at a mountain view coffee shop\n",
      "as he drove there, leiderman got a phone call from his office: his client had been arrested\n",
      "“i can’t prove anything, but you know,” he said, “i’m sure the fbi are in my computer somewhere\n",
      "” after doyon’s bail and subsequent flight to canada, leiderman, never a technophile, got serious about security\n",
      "anons showed him how to set up encrypted chat and email\n",
      "and he began to keep up a constant conversation, via wickr, with members of the group, which continues to this day\n",
      "he also became involved in a passel of other hacking cases\n",
      "he consulted on the plea deal for jeremy hammond, who hacked the private security firm stratfor\n",
      "he helped manage the defense fund for deric lostutter (aka kyanonymous) the hacker who doxxed the high school football players in the 2012 steubenville, ohio, rape case\n",
      "he pleaded the lulzsec hacker raynaldo “royal” rivera down from a maximum of 15 years in prison for hacking sony to a year and a day\n",
      "he helped on the defense of one the “fappening” hackers\n",
      "and he consulted on dozens of other cases\n",
      "along the way, he became an expert, sought out for television hits and newspaper quotes\n",
      "“jay understands the subculture of anonymous and computer hackers better than any attorney,” matthew keys said\n",
      "“he has an encyclopedic knowledge of this culture\n",
      "he gets it\n",
      "” leiderman claims not to have any advertising  —   that universal sign of the sleazy defense attorney  —   and it’s true that there are no roadside billboards in southern california bearing his face\n",
      "but he has figured out a remarkably effective, if   way of keeping his name out there: a relentless internet presence\n",
      "on twitter, facebook, and his professional blog, all of which he updates constantly, leiderman posts news, legal analysis, musings, and the odd meme related to his cases\n",
      "the relative paucity of cfaa cases enables attorneys who have litigated one or two to market themselves as experts\n",
      "five years since he first became involved with the world of hacking, leiderman has, between trials, settlements, and consultations, worked on about 50\n",
      "that allows him to claim, if not mastery, ubiquity\n",
      "yet through it all, he’s remained a fixture in ventura\n",
      "after a few rounds at victoria’s, a district attorney with a powerhouse of a mustache sidled up to leiderman, who was between him and the dart board\n",
      "they exchanged pleasantries\n",
      "leiderman said that life was good, thanks, and that he’d be heading up to sacramento soon to work on one of those crazy hacking cases he had a practice in\n",
      "“huh,” said the da\n",
      "“i had no idea\n",
      "” in january 2014, leiderman and tor ekeland filed a motion to suppress matthew keys’ taped confession\n",

      "the defense attorneys didn’t put on a case\n",
      "they didn’t call any witnesses\n",
      "they didn’t try to establish an alibi or a thorough alternative narrative for the crimes\n",
      "instead, they tried, at every turn, to slow down and frustrate the government’s introduction of evidence and claims about loss\n",
      "the government called witness after witness from the tribune company to recount an elaborate corporate response to the breach\n",
      "at the end of each witness’s testimony, the prosecution asked them to estimate how many hours they spent working on the hack, information the government then used, based on salary, to calculate loss\n",
      "most of the 10 witnesses made more than $100, 000 annually\n",
      "the defense went to work attacking the loss figures\n",
      "leiderman harped on the fact that the prosecution’s witnesses all recorded their time in “very tidy hour,   increments” that were “unreliable   …     the essence of reasonable doubt\n",
      "” leiderman and ekeland also made repeated reference to an email sent by keys’ former supervisor to a tribune attorney reading, “by the way, if you bill $1000 an hour, that would help us get this prosecuted” it was a reference to the $5, 000 figure the government needed to reach to justify bringing a felony charge\n",
      "the supervisor claimed on the stand that the email was a joke\n",
      "if the jury had a hard time deciphering the truth about the loss figures, it also had to contend with the law itself\n",
      "the cfaa is an extraordinarily complicated and technical statute, and after congratulating the jury for staying awake through the trial, leiderman spent much of his closing simplifying\n",
      "he again attacked the government’s loss calculations\n",
      "and in the face of his client’s confession, leiderman turned to a   commonsense argument about the nature of the prosecution itself\n",
      "“this is not exactly the most unforgettable act of hacktivism ever there was, but here we’re in a federal case,” leiderman said\n",
      "“and i don’t know if you know the expression ‘don’t make a federal case out of it.’ my grandpa always used to say that to me, and now i say it to you\n",
      "” in the end, the government’s evidence was too strong\n",

      "the members of the prosecution team, led by matthew segal, the chief of the special prosecutions unit for the eastern district of california, had arrived early and were sitting on spectator benches with big white spiral binders balanced on their knees\n",
      "minutes before the hearing was set to start, there was no sign of keys or his lawyers\n",

      "by contrast, the government wrote a concise   memo\n",

      "” the last argument, about the government stifling human progress, went too far\n",
      "matthew keys may have been prosecuted under an unjust law, but he was by no means a sympathetic defendant, and his crimes were neither ones of conscience or   significance\n",
      "indeed, the juxtaposition between leiderman’s sweeping rhetoric and his petty and unlikable client laid bare a simple fact: opponents of the cfaa have yet to find their edie windsor, an unimpeachably righteous figure who comes to symbolize the harm done to innocent citizens by a bad, antiquated law\n",
      "or rather they did find that person, and he killed himself\n",
      "eventually, though, there will be another aaron swartz\n",
      "there will be another person accused of violating the cfaa for whom an ideological argument compels people beyond the sphere of privacy experts and hackers, a person whose life and circumstances make the intellectual case against the law morally urgent\n",
      "perhaps jay leiderman will even be in the courtroom when that happens\n",
      "it didn’t happen in the courtroom in sacramento\n",

      "text:  south korea enters period of uncertainty with president’s impeachment - the new york times seoul, south korea  —   for her nearly four years in office, president park   of south korea cooperated closely with the united states, particularly when it came to dealing with her volatile neighbor, north korea. a vote on friday to impeach her now throws both her country and american policy in the region into deep uncertainty, as the north’s nuclear program advances and the incoming administration of donald j. trump deliberates over whether to adjust washington’s stance on how to best contain north korean aggression. ms. park, a conservative, had adopted a tough approach toward the north, focusing on stronger sanctions. her administration had also agreed to deploy an american advanced missile defense system that infuriated the chinese. yet her deep unpopularity  —   the result of a scandal over   that led members of her own party to want to oust her  —   increases the odds that the next election will be won by an advocate of friendlier relations with china. ms. park’s powers are suspended while the constitutional court considers whether to remove her permanently. if it votes to do so, south korea will hold an election for a new president in 60 days. prime minister hwang   will serve as acting president. domestically, her undoing provides the latest example of how corruption remains entrenched at the top echelons of political and corporate life in south korea, at a moment when the economy is slowing. parliament’s impeachment motion accused ms. park, the nation’s first female leader, of “extensive and serious violations of the constitution and the law. ” it followed weeks of damaging disclosures that all but paralyzed the government and produced the largest street protests in the nation’s history. ms. park suggested that she intended to fight her impeachment, telling cabinet members hours later that she would “calmly” prepare for the court deliberations and giving no hint that she would resign. “i am gravely accepting the voices of the people and the national assembly, and i sincerely hope that the confusion will come to a satisfactory end,” she said in remarks broadcast on national television. ms. park has been accused of allowing a shadowy confidante, the daughter of a religious sect leader, to exercise remarkable influence on matters ranging from choosing top government officials to her wardrobe, and of helping her extort tens of millions of dollars from south korean companies. thousands of people who had gathered outside the parliament building in the frigid cold on friday cheered when the news was announced. “my heart is beating so fast,” said han   47, who had come from paju, north of the capital. “i am so touched that people who are usually powerless can have so much power when they come together. ” a total of 234 lawmakers voted for impeachment, well over the required   threshold in the   national assembly, the lone house of parliament in south korea. the vote was by secret ballot, but the results indicated that nearly half of the 128 lawmakers in ms. park’s party, saenuri, had joined the opposition in moving to oust her. ms. park, 64, came to power in early 2013, backed mostly by older koreans who had hoped she would be a contemporary version of her father, the military dictator park   often viewed as the modernizer of south korea. instead, she became the least popular leader since the country began democratizing in the late 1980s, according to recent polls. critics said she was authoritarian and used state power to muzzle critics while shielded by a coterie of advisers. the last time south koreans took to the streets to kick out an unpopular leader, in 1960, they had to fight bloody battles with police officers armed with rifles. that uprising forced syngman rhee, the country’s founding and authoritarian president, to resign and flee into exile in hawaii. vice president lee   a rhee confidant who was at the center of a corruption scandal, and his family ended their lives in a group suicide as mobs approached their home in seoul. in subsequent decades, when south koreans demanded more democracy, their military dictators, including ms. park’s father, brutally suppressed them through martial law, torturing and even executing their leaders. in 1987, violence erupted again as people took to the streets to demand free presidential elections, forcing the military government to back down. this time, in a sign of how far south korea’s democracy has matured, peaceful crowds achieved their goal without a single arrest. increasingly large numbers of protesters gathered in the capital, including 1. 7 million people on saturday  —   the largest protest in south korean history. ms. park became the first south korean president to lose an impeachment vote since 2004, when the national assembly moved to impeach  roh   for violating election laws. two months later, the constitutional court ruled that mr. roh’s offense was too minor to justify impeachment and restored him to office. but ms. park faces much more serious accusations. still, it is difficult to predict when and how the constitutional court will rule on ms. park’s fate. removing her would require the votes of at least six of the nine constitutional court judges. among the current judges, six were appointed by ms. park or her conservative predecessor, or are otherwise seen as being close to her party. the process, which may include hearings, will buy time for ms. park’s embattled party to recover from the scandal and prepare for the next presidential election if the court decides to formally unseat her. ms. park joins the ranks of south korean leaders who have been disgraced near the end of their terms, with their relatives or aides implicated in corruption scandals. an exception was ms. park’s father, who was assassinated in 1979 at the height of his dictatorial power and before anyone dared to bring corruption charges against him. his and subsequent governments had favored a handful of   conglomerates with tax benefits, lucrative business licenses and   and   policies. the businesses were accused of returning the favors with bribes and suspicious donations. through the years, top corporations have been rocked by recurring corruption scandals, including the one that implicated ms. park and her confidante, choi  . in 1988, business tycoons were hauled into a parliamentary hearing to be questioned about millions of dollars they gave to a foundation controlled by the military dictator chun  . the scene was repeated this week, when nine business leaders, including jay y. lee, the vice chairman of samsung, and chung   the hyundai chairman, appeared at another parliamentary hearing to be questioned about millions of dollars they gave to two foundations controlled by ms. choi. ms. choi has been indicted on charges of leveraging her influence with ms. park to extort the money from the businesses. prosecutors have also identified ms. park as a criminal suspect, a first for a president, though she cannot be indicted while in office. the businessmen acknowledged giving the money, confirming that the requests had come directly from ms. park or her aides. huh   the chairman of gs group and the head of the federation of korean industries, the   lobby group that coordinated the donations, put the situation this way: “it is difficult for businesses to say no to a request from the government. that’s the reality in south korea. ” some analysts saw the vote and the huge protests as a repudiation of the entire system. “this impeachment is not only an impeachment against park ” said kim   a professor of sociology at sungkonghoe university in seoul, “but a judgment against the conservative party and the   war order that has maintained power in south korea for so many years. ”\n",

      "text:  at a loss for meds, venezuela’s mentally ill spiral downward - the new york times maracay, venezuela  —   the voices tormenting accel simeone kept getting louder. the country’s last supplies of antipsychotic medication were vanishing, and mr. simeone had gone weeks without the drug that controls his schizophrenia. reality was disintegrating with each passing day. the sounds in his head soon became people, with names. they were growing in number, crowding the tiny home he shared with his family, yelling obscenities into his ears. now the voices demanded that he kill his brother. “i didn’t want to do it,” recalled mr. simeone, 25. he took an electric grinder from the family’s garage. he switched it on. but then, to spare his brother, he attacked himself instead, slicing into his own arm until his father raced in and grabbed the grinder from his bloody hands. venezuela’s economic collapse has already decimated its health system, leaving hospitals without antibiotics, surgeons without gloves and patients dying on emergency room tables. now, thousands of mental health patients  —   many of whom had been living relatively normal lives under medication  —   are drifting into despair and psychosis because the country has run out of the vast majority of psychiatric medicines, leaving families and doctors powerless to help them, medical experts say. mental institutions have released thousands of patients because they can no longer treat them, according to physicians. the patients still being cared for now suffer in crumbling wards that can barely even feed them. doctors and nurses fear violent attacks and say they have little choice but to tie their patients to chairs, lock them up or strip them of their clothes to prevent suicides. in the city of barquisimeto, the scenes at el pampero psychiatric hospital are those of nightmares. (go inside the dysfunctional   institution here.) food shortages had left one older schizophrenic man emaciated, like a walking skeleton in a concentration camp. an epileptic man bereft of medication fell into repeated seizures, while another untreated patient lay strapped to a bed, bound at the ankles. an older woman with no drugs to control her schizophrenia crawled across the floor, past a hungry patient eating fruit that had fallen into a pool of open sewage. but most patients around the country are in the hands of families like the simeones, doctors say. family members must choose between going to work and watching over their loved ones. it is a life of searching for increasingly rare drugs, desperately hoping their relatives do not harm themselves, or others, the moment someone looks away. “when i heard that he could hurt his brother, that broke me,” said evelin de simeone, accel’s mother, recounting the day in june her son grabbed the electric grinder. venezuela, the country with the largest oil reserves in the world, once produced most of its own pharmaceutical drugs. in the early 2000s, the president at the time, hugo chávez, began a broad nationalization of venezuelan drugmakers in an effort to produce cheaper medicines. foreign companies like pfizer and eli lilly filled in the gaps by shipping drugs. then oil prices collapsed. the government began running out of hard currency, leaving it unable to import raw materials for the   factories supplying venezuelan hospitals. many foreign drug companies stopped sending medicines because the government owed them so much money. the consequence: about 85 percent of psychiatric medicines are now unavailable in venezuela, according to the country’s top pharmaceutical trade group. “the most elemental things are gone,” said robert lespinasse, a former president of the venezuelan society of psychiatry. “it’s like being impotent. ” for some, the lack of drugs has brought tragedy. on june 30, yolanda sayago, a    with severe depression, went to the ninth floor of a building in the city of san cristóbal and climbed onto a ledge. in her last moments, captured in a video that now circulates on youtube, ms. sayago looks down once, leans forward and, with her arms spread, leaps to her death. she had spent months unable to find antidepressants, said her son, jesús guillén, 43, who works for the state electricity company. she fell into a depressive relapse that pushed her toward suicide, he said. “she was always saying medicines were impossible to find here,” mr. guillén said. hobbled by such shortages, venezuela’s mental institutions now care for only a small portion of the patients they did a few years ago. in 2013, there were 23, 630   psychiatric patients in public hospitals, but only 5, 558 last year, according to a report from the health ministry. publicly, the venezuelan government denies that its hospitals are suffering, and has refused multiple offers of international medical aid. but at the invitation of doctors, journalists from the new york times visited six psychiatric wards across the country. all reported shortages not only of medicines, but of food. in el peñón hospital, the converted mansion of a former venezuelan dictator in caracas, the capital, only two patients remained, despite a capacity for 40. doctors were turning away anyone hoping to be admitted because food had not arrived regularly in months. in dr. josé ortega durán psychiatric hospital in valencia, an    schizophrenic man was tied to a metal chair. hospital workers said it was necessary because they had no medications to treat him. in el pampero hospital, jusmar torres ran out of medication for a mood disorder and depression weeks ago. now she was sitting behind bars in solitary confinement. she had been there, naked, for four days. hospital staff members had stripped her because they feared she would hang herself. weeks later, a paranoid schizophrenic who ran out of medication threw herself on top of a bunkmate at night and bit off the woman’s nose. “it wasn’t me, i did not do it,” said the schizophrenic patient, pacing a dank solitary confinement cell with bars as nurses kept their distance. down the hall, the victim sat with her face covered in bandages, writhing in pain. all the nurses could offer her was an   medicine similar to ibuprofen. a mosquito net blocked the swarms of flies drawn to her wound. dogs and cats roamed the halls. the smell of urine hung in the air. “this is too hard,” said the victim’s sister, doris villegas, gasping at the injury. “i look for her medicines, but i can’t find them now. ” the screams of emiliana rodríguez, another schizophrenic patient, echoed. she had little food and no medication for her glaucoma, leaving her hardly able to see. she could barely acknowledge those around her, but for a moment focused. “i’m not crazy,” she said. “i’m hungry. ” evila garcía, the head nurse, looked up in anguish at the patients who had been left at the hospital. “no one wants a crazy person at their house,” she said. that is not the case for accel simeone, the young man whose visions urged him to kill his brother. the family’s   home in the tropical city of maracay remains a refuge, even after he took to his arm with a grinder. soon after, a psychiatrist prescribed a different medication  —   one that could be found, at least that month  —   and the voices haunting accel grew quieter. it might have brought calm to the household if gerardo simeone, accel’s brother, were not schizophrenic, too. soon it was gerardo who was out of medication. the simeones were true believers in mr. chávez and his   revolution. mario simeone, the father, was the son of a refugee from world war ii italy who had married in venezuela, but the hard work of his parents did little to raise his prospects. when he and evelin married in the late 1980s, their first home, in a   barrio, had neither a table nor a bed. then mr. chávez took office in 1999, promising health care, education and jobs to reorient the country and its oil wealth toward the poor. the simeones became loyal supporters. mrs. simeone finished a law degree at a free,   university and began a practice specializing in lawsuits and wills. her husband, a curious tinkerer, opened a garage to fix vehicles. in 2005, the two bought a new home and filled it with appliances: four televisions, two laptops, and a washer and dryer. “our refrigerator was always full,” mrs. simeone said. but something was wrong with accel. the affable young man, nicknamed el gordo, or the fat man, had turned 18 and was starting to feel anxious, with a constant sense of being pursued. voices told him that he was gay, or that they wanted to kill him for his money. at 19, accel attacked his father with a stick. a psychiatrist in caracas immediately recognized the symptoms of schizophrenia and prescribed a number of drugs, then easy to obtain. “medication was the only way to win,” mrs. simeone said. but the battle was only beginning. accel’s younger brother, gerardo, had long been the more talkative one, a raconteur and joke teller who broke into long discourses about the history he learned at school. then el negro, as his family called him for his dark features, suddenly fell silent. “what surprises life gives you,” mario simeone said of gerardo’s schizophrenia. “who would have known it would have hit the two boys?” in many respects, life remained the same. the medication calmed the brothers’ paranoia on all but a few days, allowing evelin to continue working and mario to fix cars in the garage. accel even started working as mario’s assistant. still, accel and gerardo, once pictured in photos as boys hugging each other with wide grins, now barely spoke. accel took an interest in writing   lyrics and in cooking. gerardo remained quiet. “he was so kind and loving,” mrs. simeone said, remembering gerardo before he became ill. “he had such an amazing lexicon. ” outside the home, other changes were afoot. mr. chávez, who had cancer, died in 2013, leaving a   successor, nicolás maduro. the next year, oil prices began to decline drastically. the country found itself unable to pay for goods, services and imports. lines for food became frighteningly common in the simeones’ neighborhood. basics like cornmeal and rice were hard to come by. by 2015, inflation hit triple digits, decimating the family’s savings and often leaving evelin and mario without clients. the shortages of medicine struck hard. mrs. simeone was spending long periods each week scouring pharmacies for olanzapine, an antipsychotic drug, having little luck. by april, she was dividing the remaining pills between her sons and reducing the doses to make them last. “i said, ‘my god, neither of them will have any soon,’” she recalled. when the drug ran out in may, accel felt it first. the voices that had haunted him surged forward again. specters adopting the names of   artists like nicki minaj and ñengo flow, a puerto rican singer, pelted him with insults. the dead did, too. time and again, they told accel that he was gay and should be punished. days before he attacked himself, accel wrote a series of facebook messages to his mother. the voices, he explained, were making absurd demands, asking her to make large purchases and threatening accel if she didn’t. frustrated, evelin told him to go help his father in the garage and think of other things. accel warned that the voices were becoming violent. “they even throw grenades at me,” he wrote on may 30. on june 4, evelin and mario went to a relative’s house, leaving the brothers alone. that was when accel’s voices told him to kill gerardo. “they came and told me to do it, to do it, to do it,” accel recalled as his brother looked on. “i didn’t know if i was alive or dead. ” torn between the voices and his conscience, accel left his brother and headed to a shed where his father kept tools. the voices continued, urging him on. “i felt the need to take a screwdriver and put it in my chest, just where my heart is,” he said. accel settled on a grinder on the floor. he plugged it in, switched it on. “they said i needed to keep sawing until i had cut off my arm,” accel said. he had just started when mario returned home and wrestled the grinder from his son’s hands. “he was just standing there, like it was normal and nothing happened,” mario said. the wounds did not hit any arteries or veins. the large gashes in his arms are now scarring. but the costs from the day the family now refers to as “the crisis” are still adding up. evelin, who had hardly been able to work in order to watch over the brothers, has quit work entirely. mario fixes cars to pay for medication for his sons, when it can be found, lamenting how far the family’s fortunes have fallen. he recalled when they bought their home in 2005. the price was 45 million bolívars, an amount that soon dropped to 45, 000 after the government replaced the currency with a new devalued one in 2008. now inflation has made that figure seem laughable. “the price of our house is barely enough for a cellphone,” he said. he wanted someone to blame. “this is a fanatic state,” he said. “if you really love a country, how could you leave it without food, work or medicine?” unlike his brother, gerardo wasn’t prone to violence when his pills ran out. by july, when most of his medications were gone, he drifted into his own world, standing calmly in a corner for long spells as the rest of the family sat in the living room, watching television. he would look up and answer a question now and then, but it was as if he were dreaming elsewhere. “we call him our swiss guard,” mario said wryly. waiting in line and scrounging for medicines are not the only daily struggles for the simeone family. the real trial is holding the strained, at times violent, household together. accel still hears voices in his head, which now tell him that he can no longer sleep in his bed. he has moved to his parents’ room. mario and evelin’s grown son spends the night with them. guilt haunts evelin. she is troubled that she has not searched as hard as she can for medicine for gerardo. “i am tired,” she said. “this is too much sometimes. ” she began to cry and walked away. accel looked up, sensing something was wrong. “it’s allergies again,” she told him. the tiny house feels cramped, with a sense of cabin fever. when there is enough medicine to clear his mind, accel takes to writing new   lyrics. one is about his relationship with gerardo. another, called “the lights are out,” tells of the constant blackouts in his neighborhood. accel opened his bedroom door and pointed at lyrics written on the wall. every inch has been covered by his frenetic writing. mario spends most of his days tinkering in the garage, muttering about parts that are no longer found in venezuela. gerardo’s silence now frustrates him. “there are times i get mad at him,” he said. “i just don’t understand why he’s behaving like that. i tell him: ‘what’s wrong with you? don’t act like a stupid person! ’” gerardo looked on,   and silent. mario looked ashamed, then ran across the room, grabbing his son, lifting him a few inches and twirling him around. when he let go, gerardo was still expressionless. then his eyes grew wide. a smile cracked across his face. the whole family started to laugh. gerardo looked at the floor and started laughing, too.\n",

      "text:  alabama prisons ruled ’horrendously inadequate,’ must improve a federal judge is ordering alabama to improve the way it treats mentally ill prisoners after ruling that the state fails to provide constitutionally adequate mental health care in state lockups. u. s. district judge myron thompson of montgomery says alabama is putting prisoners’ lives at risk with ”horrendously inadequate” care and a lack of services for inmates with psychiatric problems. the ruling comes in a class action lawsuit brought by inmates who argued the conditions violated the u. s. constitution’s ban on cruel and unusual punishment. ”this ruling means that prisoners with mental illness may finally get the treatment they have been denied for so long,” says maria morris, senior supervising attorney with the southern poverty law center in montgomery, which represents some of prisoners who sued. ”the suffering some of these men and women have endured is excruciating and inhumane,” morris says. ”we are pleased judge thompson has demanded that the state of alabama meet its constitutional obligation to provide adequate care.” potential remedies, in a   ruling, thompson outlines ”serious systemic deficiencies” in the delivery of mental health services. he says inmates are subject to serious harm and increased suicide risk in the way the state identifies, treats, houses, and disciplines   prisoners. thompson writes about the severe effects of warehousing, rather than treating seriously   prisoners. he says the impacts were crystallized when a prisoner who testified during the civil trial last year later committed suicide by hanging himself in his cell. ”without question, [jamie] wallace’s testimony and the tragic event that followed darkly draped all the subsequent testimony like a pall,” says thompson in the ruling. at the time, he approved an interim settlement in which the alabama department of corrections (adoc) agreed to 15 changes, including putting a licensed mental health worker in every state prison, and providing constant observation for inmates on suicide watch. thompson is now ordering   meetings between corrections officials and lawyers for the inmates to come up with a remedy. ”the court emphasizes that given the severity and urgency of the need for   care explained in this opinion, the proposed relief must be both immediate and long term,” he says. alabama gov. kay ivey says she’s committed to providing   conditions for all prisoners, and plans to meet with corrections commissioner jefferson dunn, and legislative leaders. ”all appropriate options at my disposal, including the possibility of a special session, will be considered as potential remedies to address the judge’s order,” ivey says in a written statement. deliberate indifference, critics say the fix should have already come. judge thompson finds evidence that the state has shown ”deliberate indifference” to the unconstitutional conditions. ”officials admitted on the stand that they have done little to nothing to fix problems on the ground, despite their knowledge that those problems may be putting lives at risk,” thompson says. the problems are driven by chronic overcrowding and understaffing, acknowledged by commissioner dunn who testified about wrestling with the ”  monster” plaguing alabama’s prisons. state lockups are at nearly double capacity, with staffing levels that are half what they should be. for example, as the trial was starting last december, the state had just 21 doctors for more than   prisoners. ”for far too long, alabama prisons have been little more than warehouses where many people struggling with mental illness have been hidden away and abandoned by the state,” says lisa borden, an attorney with the law firm baker donelson, which represents some of the inmates who sued. ”we look forward to now having the opportunity for our clients to receive real treatment for their illnesses, and to seeing them afforded the basic dignity to which any human being is entitled,” bordon says. dunn says the order requires a broader conversation with political leaders. ”while portions of the trial focused upon issues related to mental health care, it also highlighted many of the other challenges facing the department like our outdated facilities and our   needs in the area of security,” says dunn. ”we look forward to having an open and frank conversation with our state leadership about how to make meaningful investments into our department to ensure the safety of our staff, the security of our facilities and the   of those in our care.” alabama’s   legislature has passed some sentencing reforms and other measures aimed at reducing inmate populations in recent years but stopped short of approving a massive prison building program this year. escalating violence is also a problem for adoc. last year the u. s. justice department opened a civil rights probe into whether prisoners are safe from physical harm and sexual abuse at the hands of both other prisoners and guards. the investigation came after several inmates and guards were killed or injured in violent confrontations in state prisons.\n",

      "text:  parents of virginia teen who committed suicide sue school counselor  three weeks before    jay gallagher took his own life, a worried friend who lived in colorado sent an email to his school counselor at potomac falls high in potomac falls, va. telling the counselor that jay was saying things “with suicidal content,” according to a lawsuit filed in loudoun county circuit court on friday. “he’s usually crying alone in his room because he doesn’t seem to have a good relationship with his parents,” the girl wrote. the counselor, richard bader, met with gallagher, sending the girl a reassuring response: “talked with him today. thank you for bringing it to my attention. ” but should bader have notified gallagher’s parents? that question is at the center of a $5 million wrongful death lawsuit filed by jay’s parents, erin and timothy gallagher, against bader. the suit accuses the school counselor of negligence and ignoring school guidelines that direct counselors to notify parents if their children express suicidal thoughts. but julia judkins, bader’s attorney, said the suit does not tell the full story. judkins said that the teen told bader not to talk to his parents about their meeting and denied that he was suicidal. “they’ve left out the fact that this young man was 18 years old and he had the right to tell mr. bader, ‘please don’t tell my parents,’ ” judkins said. robert hall, the attorney for the parents, said they had no idea their son was in trouble and believe they could have saved his life had they known he was suicidal. the parental notifications guidelines “need to be enforced,” hall said. “this was jay gallagher’s only opportunity to be saved. ” according to hall and to the lawsuit, jay gallagher was a stellar student and had been admitted to virginia tech. but unbeknownst to his parents, he put intense pressure on himself to perform well in school and was under extreme stress. jay’s father found his son dead in his room feb. 3. after his death, one of jay’s friends, a young woman who had moved to colorado from loudoun county, reached out to his parents to tell them that she had emailed jay’s school counselor to tell him of her concerns in the weeks before jay’s death. “last night was the most concerning due to the suicidal thoughts and the self harm,” the girl wrote in an email to the counselor in   adding that she did not believe his parents were “open to discussing issues or emotions. ” “i wanna say stress stems from busy schedule, lacking self worth and various expectations. ” bader met with gallagher, but never filled out the suicide screening form and never notified his parents. hall argues that the schools’ suicide prevention action plan required bader to follow those steps. judkins disagrees. “mr. bader didn’t do anything wrong,” judkins said, adding that their conversation did not meet the threshold for a suicide screening or parental notification. “it wasn’t applicable given the communications between mr. bader and young jay gallagher. ” the suit is a culmination of months of failed talks between school officials and the parents. hall said the parents sought to clarify the guidelines or policy that outline when a counselor should contact parents and to ensure that all counselors were aware and trained on the guidelines. the gallaghers wrote in a post on a facebook page they created in their son’s memory that they filed the lawsuit “with a great deal of reluctance” and merely hoped to push the school system to improve its procedures. hall said he asked school attorneys to meet for a confidential mediation session overseen by a retired judge and that the school system stonewalled the family and refused. but judkins said the mediation session stalled because the family asked the school board’s insurance company to be present and did not lay out their demands ahead of time.   get updates on your area delivered via email  \n",

[“kaisen served in the u. s. navy from 1958 to 1962, working on the uss denebola, a ship that delivered refrigerated items and equipment to ships in the fleet,” according to his friend thomas farley, as cited by fox news.   after leaving the navy, kaisen went to work for the long beach police department, where he was severely injured in a car accident, causing him to rely on pain medication over the following decades. the new york times quotes two sources connected to the northport va medical center who said kaisen came there on sunday seeking   care for a mental health issue but was turned away.  according to these sources, the e. r. staff did not tell kaisen that the mental health facility was open 24 hours a day, and a psychologist was on call. for what it’s worth, the long island press notes the medical center’s website claims, “there is always a caring mental health doctor available   in our emergency room. ” he then went to the parking lot outside the medical center’s nursing home facility, where newsday says he was found “bleeding and unresponsive” after shooting himself. although the hospital is currently denying that kaisen presented himself to the emergency room, the new york times’s anonymous sources were scathing in their criticism. “he went to the e. r. and was denied service. and then he went to his car and shot himself,” said one source, identified as a hospital employee. “someone dropped the ball. they should not have turned him away. ” the times reports this is yet another va facility with a troubled history: the northport hospital has been under scrutiny for mismanagement and poor care since the new york times reported in may that it had closed all five of its operating rooms for months after   black particles began falling from air ducts. the office of representative lee zeldin, a republican whose first congressional district is on long island, had been looking into the allegations, eric amidon, mr. zeldin’s chief of staff, said in an email to the times in june. newsday reports that u. s. house representatives steve israel and peter king sent a letter to fbi director james comey on thursday demanding an “expeditious and transparent investigation” of the incident. the fbi was already involved in the case because kaisen’s death occurred on federal property, but there was no suspicion of criminal activity, and kaisen is believed to have been alone when he died. “i’m a vietnam vet  —   disabled from agent orange  —   and he was always looking out for me. he was such a faithful guy. he was such a big advocate for veterans and that’s what makes it’s so sad,” kaisen’s friend thomas farley told fox news. kaisen’s work for his fellow veterans might not be finished yet. “your death is not in vain. through your tragedy, may the bureaucrats change policies to help others that were in your situation,” read one message left on the funeral home’s website, quoted by the long island press.\n",

[“regardless of the numbers or rates, one veteran suicide is one too many,” david shulkin, the va’s undersecretary for health, said in a statement the group released on thursday. the va had previously estimated that 22 veterans were committing suicide per day in 2013. both numbers cast light on what lawmakers and concerned citizens alike are recognizing as an epidemic.  shulkin told the associated press (ap) of the importance of   the idea of receiving counseling to help people feel more comfortable reaching out for help. he reportedly said the va is working on partnering with advocacy groups throughout the united states to ensure veterans get the help they need. the ap pointed out that that the increase in attention on veteran suicides “comes at a time when the va has reported a huge upswing in veterans seeking medical care as they have returned from conflicts in the middle east. ” the va study noted that   or 65 percent, of all veterans who committed suicide were 50 or older. “we as a nation must do more to encourage veterans in need to seek treatment and ask for help,” rep. jeff miller ( ) chairman of the house committee on veterans’ affairs, told the ap. the ap also noted that while the rate of suicides for   has also increased in recent years, it has increased at a greater pace for veterans. the va study found that veterans are 21 percent more likely to commit suicide than their civilian counterparts. in 2014 alone, nearly 7, 400 veterans took their own lives. the highest suicide rates occur among veterans who do not participate in the va’s mental health programs. the study also found that the “risk for suicide was 2. 4 times higher among female veterans when compared to u. s. civilian adult females. ” last year, breitbart news highlighted that a damning report published by the inspector general for veterans affairs revealed that a number of veterans’   documents at the los angeles va regional office (varo) was placed in employee shred boxes without being processed and that all but one of the documents labeled for shredding had the potential to affect veterans’ benefits. the va’s previous study on veterans’ suicide rates had only incorporated data from less than half of the states and reportedly did not include states like california and texas, two states with a high number of veterans. however, the ap noted that va has reportedly expanded its database, following pressure from veterans groups, and has incorporated records from the department of defense to help identify veterans who had not enrolled in the va’s numerous programs in an attempt to help change that. the va has made a   veterans crisis line (vcl) available to veterans. callers should dial     (8255) “and then ‘press 1’ to reach highly skilled responders trained in suicide prevention and crisis intervention. ” a chat service and texting option are reportedly also available. follow adelle nazarian on twitter @adellenaz.\n",

[harry reid to lay aside gloves, retire from senate] while his portrait was unveiled, reid was celebrated late thursday by hillary clinton and vice president biden who led a cascade of speeches in his honor. clinton began her remarks joking about her campaign loss, saying her speech thursday was “not exactly the speech in the capitol” she had hoped to give. she noted that she, biden and reid were all leaving electoral politics at the same time and it was up to those still there to defend reid’s accomplishments. “we’re all counting on you,” she said. earlier in the day, after three decades in the senate, four years in the house and almost 50 years of political combat in nevada, the guy from searchlight basked in the national political glow of a consequential career now passed. his longtime rival, senate majority leader mitch mcconnell ( .) praised reid’s tenacity. “if there’s one thing we know about harry, he doesn’t give up easily,” mcconnell said, explaining reid’s   style in the senate and also his pursuit of his high school sweetheart, landra reid, whom he married at 19.      senate minority leader harry reid ( .) bid farewell to the u. s. senate, giving one last speech on the senate floor on dec. 8.

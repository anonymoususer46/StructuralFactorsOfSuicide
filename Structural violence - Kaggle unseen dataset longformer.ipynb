       "[' underage sex scandal rocks police departments in northern california  a sex scandal involving a teenage prostitute and more than two dozen police officers has shaken several law enforcement agencies in northern california, prompting multiple investigations and the resignation of a major city police chief. the woman, now 18, alleges she was involved with at least 31 officers from across the bay area, accepting money in exchange for sex and, at times, tips on when and where police would be cracking down on prostitution. some of the encounters, she said, happened when she was a minor. “be safe today!! want some advice?” one officer texted her before warning about an undercover sting. “thank you daddy,” she texted back, according to messages she provided to local media. “i appreciate it ion wanna go to jail lol. ” the allegations have implicated officers in seven separate police departments, including the oakland police department, where five officers were placed on administrative leave during an internal investigation. two of those officers have since resigned. a deputy with the contra costa county sheriff’s department and an inspector with the alameda county district attorney’s office have been placed on administrative leave in connection with the allegations, officials told buzzfeed news. but the allegations that police officers had been involved with the young sex worker exploded into a   scandal when one of the officers, accused of having sex with her when she was 17, killed himself last year. a suicide note left behind by the oakland police officer reportedly revealed his relationship with the teen and named four other uniformed officers who had some sort of contact with her as well, touching off an internal investigation that would eventually expand to several other law enforcement agencies. according to the teen, who goes by the name “celeste guap” on social media, she had sexual relationships with 14 oakland police officers  —   including three while she was a minor  —   five richmond police officers, three san francisco police officers, one stockton police officer, one livermore police officer, four alameda county deputies, and three contra costa county deputies. “we are dealing with disgusting allegations that disturb me greatly,” oakland mayor libby schaaf said at a press conference wednesday. “the culture of this department does not tolerate unethical behavior, sexual misconduct, or lying. ” not only are departments looking into allegations that their officers became involved with a teen who has described herself as a prostitute, but officials are also looking into the possibility officers might have had sex with her while she was a minor. the shocking allegations were first reported by the east bay express earlier this month, which detailed how guap became involved with oakland police officer brendan o’brien in february 2015 while running away from a pimp. guap was a minor at the time. when the two ran into each other again weeks later, she told the paper they began to flirt and soon after were dating and having sex. guap has told reporters, however, that she became involved with other police officers as well, partly to avoid going to jail. law enforcement officials told buzzfeed news that guap was personally connected with police departments in the bay area. her mother is a dispatcher for the oakland police department. her stepfather also works as a dispatcher, although it was not immediately clear for what agency. according to the east bay express, the teen eventually told an oakland policesergeant days before o’brien’s death that she had been seeing the officer despite being underage. the department had been looking into the allegations, but the young officer left a suicide note behind talking about his contact with guap and named four other officers who may also have had a sexual relationship with the girl, the east bay express and san jose mercury news reported. “the only officer i ever messed with underage is sadly gone now,” guap wrote last month on facebook. “so i don’t know why this is still being brought up. ” the suicide and resulting scandal prompted two oakland police investigations and led to the abrupt resignation last week of police chief sean whent. oakland mayor libby schaaf said the chief, who was hired to help reform the troubled department, was stepping down due to “personal reasons. ” but local media reported whent was actually forced out of his position as a result of his handling of the growing scandal, and allegations that some of the officers involved with guap had given her advance notice of undercover prostitution stings. the oakland police department has been under federal oversight due to misconduct since 2003, and the department’s independent police monitor reportedly became aware of the allegations in march. whent was replaced by interim police chief ben fairow, but, in a bizarre twist, fairow was suddenly removed from the position on wednesday, just six days after he had been appointed to the job. schaaf said at a press conference she had asked fairow to step down after “information that i received monday raised concerns for me about whether he can effectively lead this department at this particular moment in time and in this critical transition. ” bay area rapid transit police chief kenton rainey later said fairow resigned because, “while he was married, he had a personal relationship with a consenting adult more than a decade ago. ” fairow has since been reassigned to his old position as deputy chief of the department’s support services division. along with the multiple internal investigations being conducted at the law enforcement agencies, buzzfeed news has learned district attorneys in alameda and contra costa counties are also conducting separate investigations into the allegations against deputies in their counties and officers from the oakland, richmond, san francisco, stockton, and livermore police departments. so far, no criminal charges have been filed. “while it is our practice not to discuss pending investigations, i can firmly state that we do not and will not turn a blind eye to human trafficking or the sexual exploitation of a minor, whether the offender is a civilian or a law enforcement officer,” alameda county district attorney nancy o’malley said in a statement. “we take the allegation seriously and will not tolerate this alleged conduct by our employee, as we uphold the highest ethical standards,” sgt. jimmy lee of the contra costa county sheriff’s department told buzzfeed news. the san francisco police department is also conducting an internal investigation. “we are aware of the investigation and are conducting a review to determine if any of our members had any inappropriate contact with the victim,” san francisco police officer carlos manfredi said. alameda county sheriff officials said their deputies were determined to have not conducted any illegal or unethical behavior, although they were found to have had contact with the sex worker. “we have no reason to believe that they did anything illegal or unethical in their contacts with ms. guap,” sgt. ray kelly of the alameda county sheriff’s department told buzzfeed news. the investigation determined that guap was 18 when she was had contact with the alameda deputies, and that there was no indication that money was exchanged for sex, kelly said. stockton police officials also said their officer had been cleared of wrongdoing. kelly said that the deputies and guap met each other through facebook, and that they did not know she was a sex worker at the time. they were also unaware of her involvement with other officers, or deputies in their own agency. exactly what kind of contact she had with officers in multiple agencies will be reviewed by the multiple investigations. on her facebook account, guap often posted pictures of herself with uniformed police officers. and on tuesday, she said she had recently been questioned by investigators for more than 12 hours about her contact with police officers in the area. guap did not return multiple requests for comment from buzzfeed news. in addition to the multiple internal investigations and reviews by two district attorney offices, law enforcement sources said federal officials are reviewing the allegations. spokespersons for the fbi and department of justice told buzzfeed news they could not confirm or deny the existence of any ongoing investigations. the california attorney general’s office also said state officials are monitoringthe ongoing investigations. “the allegations of misconduct, if true, are disturbing and reflect a serious breach of the trust placed in law enforcement by the communities we are sworn to serve,” a spokesperson said. “there must be swift accountability for any wrongdoing. ”  ',\n",
       " 'keystone pipeline defiance triggers further assault on citizens’ rights bret clanton might not belong to the most obvious group of opponents to the proposed keystone xl pipeline. but when a survey crew from transcanada arrived on his property eight years ago, the rancher and registered republican  —   worried they were cattle thieves  —   says he called the sheriff’s department, and marched out to confront them. he says the encounter changed his life, and set up a battle that would come to dominate his existence. on the outer perimeter of the clanton ranch, where three large sandstone rock formations stand over the otherwise empty horizon, transcanada later told him it planned to dig up three miles of his land and lay a section of the keystone xl pipeline. transcanada also hopes to bulldoze along another two and half miles of his pastures to make way for an access road. “i’ve lived here all my life and this ground is pretty much as god, or whoever, made it, and i just want it stay that way,” he says. clanton fought from the beginning and lobbied the state government for several years. but he was made aware almost instantly it was likely to be a losing fight. “from the very first meeting [with transcanada] i was informed they would have power of condemnation,” he says. the bleak assessment was correct. as soon as the xl route had received the necessary state approval in south dakota back in 2010, transcanada was essentially able to seize control of any private land it needed, in return for a fee, through the power of eminent domain. a principle protected by the fifth amendment to the us constitution, eminent domain permits the seizure of private land for “public use” in exchange for “just compensation”. it was used by government at the turn of the 19th century, when clanton’s great grandfather arrived in south dakota on horseback, driving cattle from the south, to reclaim land for public infrastructure and to preserve historic sites. but emiment domain has since morphed to empower various gas and oil pipeline companies to construct across the us, buoyed by a 2005 supreme court ruling that found private entities providing “economic development” were essentially providing a public service. advocates estimate that dozens of landowners in south dakota and montana were essentially forced to settle with transcanada to avoid eminent domain enactments during the obama administration. close to the   border with montana, clanton’s remote ranch, outside the small town of buffalo, is one of the first properties the xl will cross in south dakota. it marks the guardian’s first   in the state during a trip that traces the proposed pipeline’s entire length through the us to examine the battles that have reignited after the trump administration resurrected the project. it is not just environmentalists and native americans lined up against the construction. registered republican ranchers like clanton are also among the opposition, pitting them against the leaders of their own party who have long supported the pipeline. every republican candidate in the 2016 presidential race supported the project. donald trump, himself a frequent user of eminent domain in private business, described the power as “wonderful” during the campaign. clanton will not say how he voted last year and does not want to engage with the obvious contradictions between his preferred party and his current situation. “if hillary clinton had been elected, she would’ve done the same thing. it was inevitable,” he says. (during the election, clinton pledged to oppose the project but had expressed tentative support for it during her tenure as secretary of state.)  clanton is clinging to the hope that if oil prices continue to fall, the construction may no longer be economically viable. but he expresses a certain resignation already. perhaps the only landowner still holding out transcanada in south dakota lives 350 miles   of clanton’s ranch. john harter’s ancestors have ranched cattle close to the   border with nebraska since 1939. the xl is scheduled to bisect a   grazing pasture that has been in the family since then, and the    is preparing to battle until the bitter end. guided by christian faith and the values he learned through shotokan karate  —   harter is a   black belt  —   he says: “i don’t believe in being bullied, and i won’t be bullied. ” transcanada eventually took harter to eminent domain, he claims. but he is now arguing that the easement is void because of what he describes as a breach of contract.  “i have told transcanada that they do not have a legal easement to my property, and if they entered my property, that i would remove them, and if necessary with force,” harter says.  transcanada says it has completed easements with every landowner on the xl route within montana and south dakota. “we have been working with mr harter for several years and we are committed to working with him in the future,” said transcanada spokesman terry cunha.  harter drives out to the pasture they plan to bulldoze, his navy blue 1978 ford   bouncing on tufts of windswept wild grass, and reveals he, too, is a registered republican. the contradiction remains striking, and harter is clearly discomforted by it. “being a conservative is one thing,” he says about those in his party who support the project. “being a blind conservative is another. ” but it is not only these ranchers’ right to their land that is under threat in south dakota. it is their right to protest, too. the 150 miles from clanton’s pastures to the town of eagle butte, in the heart of the cheyenne river reservation, is bathed in intense sunlight that colours the distant mountain ranges in a wash of blue. here, small casinos litter the roadside, and tumbleweed rolls across the streets. the xl is is set to pass just outside the reservation, and will cross underneath the cheyenne river, a major tributary of the missouri river and the place the reservation’s sioux tribe get their water from. last month, south dakota’s republican governor dennis daugaard, a longtime supporter of the xl, signed senate bill 176. the new law allows local officials to prohibit groups larger than 20 from congregating on state land, and could criminalize those who attempt to protest on state highways. (the montana legislature is considering similar legislation.) it was pushed through, without consultation with tribal leaders in the state, as an emergency measure, a   response to the direct action protests at standing rock in north dakota. many native americans here view the new law as a further assault on their rights after centuries of disenfranchisement. hundreds are already veterans of standing rock, which borders this reservation to the north. the council chairman harold frazier was present throughout these protests, watching as his contemporaries were teargassed and shot with rubber bullets by police. “it is something i will never forget,” he says, later branding the new law unconstitutional and suggesting it will be challenged in court. “it was so awesome to see the strength of our people. ” protest camps, set up to oppose the xl, are already starting to populate at eagle butte and other locations throughout the reserve, but leaders won’t discuss their plans in detail. as it is on the fort peck reservation in montana, people here are furious about the perceived lack of consultation with transcanada and government officials. the renewed fight against the xl is coupled with a desire to galvanize the community here against the many struggles they face.  almost 40% of residents in eagle butte live below the poverty line, and in the hours before the guardian arrived, the community held a funeral for a    girl who killed herself days before. there had been 20 suicide attempts by young girls on the reserve in the past two weeks, a tribal spokesman said. ninety miles south, in the state capital of pierre  —   a slight detour from the xl’s proposed route  —   the governor was not available to be interviewed about the new law. instead, the administration put up a member of daugaard’s cabinet, who is adamant the legislation does not discriminate against native american protesters. steve emery, the republican secretary for tribal relations and himself a member of the rosebud sioux tribe, is, of course, expected to hold the governor’s line on the issue. but during an interview at his secretarial office, he made an honest admission that is likely to frustrate his boss by undermining the administration’s primary justification for supporting the xl in the first place. “i certainly don’t think it [the xl pipeline] is going to make any great economic impact on south dakota or on the native tribes that share our borders,” he says.  then what is it that the tribes in this state do not understand about the pipeline that explains the daugaard administration’s support for it?  he pauses, takes a sip of water, and, after an awkward silence, responds: “i am not really sure how to answer that, because i am sure they probably know more about the pipeline than i do. ”  emery’s rosebud reservation is the last large population concentration the xl will affect in south dakota. the pipeline is set to cross just north of the reserve, which sits at the very top of the ogallala aquifer. this groundwater source is one of the world’s largest aquifers, covering around 174, 000 sq miles and crossing underneath eight states, supplying drinking water to nearly 2 million people. even a small undetected leak in this area, according to the independent analysis conducted by engineering professor john stansbury, could contaminate surrounding water sources with intolerable benzene levels “posing serious health threats to anyone [in the vicinity] using the underlying ogallala aquifer for drinking water or agriculture”. troy heinert says he is one of those in the potential crosshairs. the aquifer supplies water to his herd of rodeo horses that perform at events around the country. heinert is also emery’s cousin and a democratic state senator, one of only a handful of native americans in the   state legislature. he was one of the few to vote against senate bill 176, which he brands “dangerous”. activists on this reserve are planning to resist construction if a last ditched state court appeal against the permit in south dakota fails. heinert empathises with his cousin’s inability to articulate a single reason native americans should warm to the project. “south dakota has very clean water,” he says, as his herd of horses gallop over the pasture to come in to drink. “we have over 300, 000 people who receive water from rural water systems that could be affected by this. we have no plan if something were to happen. ” “we can live without oil,” he says. “we can’t live without water. ” support the guardian’s climate change and environment reporting by becoming a member or making a   contribution.

       " 'pride and pain in trump country: ’we all grew up poor, but we had a community’ on a recent sunday evening, 30 people come to worship in a wooden home by the side of a kentucky county road. a handmade tin sign nailed to a lightpost announces “the house of worship, everyone welcome”. inside, congregants fan themselves, waiting to take their turn at the pulpit. the church doesn’t have a minister and anyone is welcome. the service doesn’t end until everyone who wishes to has sung, read or preached. josh bailey, 14 years free of alcohol, riffs for 20 minutes, mixing scripture with stories of his past. “i used to drink all the time, until i discovered the lord. ain’t never had a buzz like jesus christ. ” josh and his wife jenny have, he says, “nothing beyond their children and their faith in jesus christ”. they receive a disability check (he has seizures) and payments for the odd jobs she finds. they don’t have a car, so getting to the church requires a ride from a neighbor. another member has brought a friend, a local woman who disappeared for four years into the larger towns up north, until she was found living on the streets and invited back. she told of her descent into meth, and of what it meant to be welcomed into a church. “i have had it rough, but with you, and the lord, i will keep my head high. ” it was four hours of euphoria that ended with everyone shaking hands and hugging  —   a reminder that, as josh preached: “if you shake my hand in church, you will shake my hand outside in the world. ” the house of worship sits in floyd county, at the center of the eastern kentucky coalfields, where there is plenty of despair, and plenty of support for donald trump. while cities such as new york, los angeles and dc have thrived, floyd county, with a history of economic hardship, has declined further. the coal industry has been cut almost in half, addiction is rising, and town centers are being emptied by walmarts. and while technology has helped decrease the sense of distance from bigger cities, the county remains economically and culturally separate. while the us has grown more diverse, it has stayed almost all white. while many americans define themselves by their work, the residents of floyd county define themselves equally by things outside of work. this is partly by desire, but also by necessity, since good jobs are rare. instead, they find pride in their community: through church, morning breakfast groups, or at   tables outside the walmart. the real energy of prestonsburg (floyd county’s seat, population 3, 500) is at its edges. at the north end of town are   franchises strung along the road heading out of town  —   dq, hardee’s, mcdonald’s. each evening they fill with families eating dinner, and each morning with large groups who meet to socialize over coffee. each restaurant has a dedicated group, but the largest collects at the hardee’s. it comprises up to 30 mostly older men. the hardcore regulars have printed up laminated breakfast club membership cards with a joking slogan: “there is great pleasure to be gained from useless knowledge. ” for many, this is their new job. darvin burchet, 79, used to run coalmines, before they closed “because of obama’s war on coal”. when he walks in, the others clear a prime corner space for him. he was the boss when many of them had jobs, and today he remains so. he proudly wears a trump hat, as do many other morning members, and when the talk turns to politics, he is clear about why. “society has fallen apart and the economy has gone to hell. finding a good worker now is almost impossible. people here lack pride. can’t fully blame them. you work all day and then go home and see a neighbor just getting a government handout. why am i busting my ass while he isn’t and doing just as good?” the rest of the table nods as he speaks. “my father was a coalminer. almost everyone here’s father was a coalminer. we all grew up poor, but had what we needed. it was a community. when someone’s house burned to the ground, we all helped out to rebuild it. now guys will just steal the nails to sell for scrap metal, to buy drugs. ” down the road at the mcdonald’s, orbin and benny slone, cousins aged 75 and 78, join another group. much is the same. both are sons of coalminers, and both come each morning to meet friends. orbin was a teacher and a bluegrass musician, and benny worked in the factories up north before returning home. when i ask them about the town’s changes, they take turns speaking, weaving their voices into one. “we used to be   here. people wouldn’t take gifts. we had pride and  . then we were flooded with gifts from the government. it took our pride away. now people only take pride in drugs. ” this nostalgia is voiced by everyone in town, and is a change that is almost uniformly blamed on obama. it is a change that is clear in the statistics. while coal jobs in the region having dropped 40% in last decade, and coal production 60% deaths from overdoses have surged. unlike in other towns struggling with drugs, there are few visible signs. the streets are clean, without discarded needles, and homes well kept. there are no clusters of people milling about on corners. the impact is clear, though, above the city, on a mountaintop that once was mined for coal but is now home to a rehab center, run by mountain comprehensive care, one of the town’s largest employers. the center is the temporary home to dozens of men and women drawn from all across eastern kentucky all are intent on ridding drugs from their lives, or following a mandate that they do so. one of them is jerri baird, 27, raised in a small home four miles from the closest town. her dad was a nurse, and her grandfather mined coal. she started using drugs at 14. her stresses came from many directions, including growing up gay in a pentecostal church. “i was bad in school. didn’t ever feel i fit in. grandfather smacked me in the face when he found out i liked women. strong coalminer slap. right across the face. ” like many others, she notes the drugs offered relief from the boredom. “there was nobody doing nothing where i come from. nobody working. nothing. ” when i asked her what she planned to do when back in town, she looked quizzical. “like for work? i mean, there are no good jobs around. i done a few things. clerked at restaurants, gas stations. those sort of things. but that isn’t much of work to brag about. ” the loss of coal and the increase in drug use is felt in the heart of the community, in churches similar to the house of worship. the city has more than two dozen that fill every sunday.  at the highland free will baptist church david garrett, 66, has been preaching for decades. he is a decorated vietnam veteran (three bronze stars) a lifelong coalminer, and the son of a coalminer. he spoke to me just after sunday service. “in mining, it is feast or famine. right now, we are in a famine and the community is suffering, but we help each other out. ” as he spoke, he gestured to the congregation, half of whom were on their knees, washing the feet of the other half, in a yearly ritual.  “sometimes it just isn’t enough. i have to bury too many congregants, many who kill themselves. one woman who i knew since she was a baby shot herself in the stomach with a . 38. the world is too material, and people don’t think they need the community. brother. do they ever need it. ” at the other end of the city, beneath mountains layered from mining, is a shopping plaza with walmart and other discount brands. while many blame walmart’s arrival for the destruction of community by closing local shops, it is now an integral part of prestonsburg, functioning as the de facto town square. it is the place where people come to gossip and teenagers to hang out, busy enough that the police patrol it on bicycles. wooden tables and metal benches lining the plaza are filled with workers taking smoking breaks. when i ask one group of workers and their friends about coal, it sets off a chain of comments that spin into a long political argument  —   all polite. obama is largely blamed, and the phrase “obama’s war on coal” is being thrown around.  across the plaza, at a wooden table outside a grocery store, esther blair, 63, is taking a break with a group. when her friends go inside, she smiles at me, and when i ask her about her life, she seems surprised. she is shy and polite. “i am not sure i have much to say that would be interesting to anyone beyond prestonsburg. ” i tell her she does, which surprises her. she pauses to smoke, each sentence almost whispered, each punctuated with a period of silence.  “i work as a cashier. i always have. but i worry a lot. about paying my bills. about my child’s life. about my friends. i lost my husband two years ago. i have had a very hard life. i can’t win for losing. ” in the parking lot, paul gillespie, 28, is in his truck waiting for his wife in the goodwill. he lost his leg from cancer when he was young and was placed in special education before quitting high school as a freshman. he pivots from the cab of the truck to the back edge, swinging his body on the doorframe. “i hated school. i was teased all the time. the other kids called me retard, or cripple. i learned to fight them. i had to. ”  i ask him about the confederate flag attached to his truck. “i love the flag, because i love fishing and hunting. that is what it means to be from the south, and i am proud of being from the south. ” during my week in prestonsburg, i kept crossing paths with an older man who worked in the plaza. we chatted often. he was curious about why i was here, what new york was like. each time i would ask to take his picture, and each time he refused with a cliched joke: “i am wanted by the fbi,” “i might break your camera. ” the last day, i thanked him for his time, and tried once more. he again declined, but this time he turned more serious. “i like you. but odds are you or your paper is going to write about   dirty dumb hillbillies filling their arms with heroin and pipes with meth. everyone does that. they come here see the pretty landscape, but they don’t see the goodness. ”',\n",
       " 'canada holds emergency debate over aboriginal suicide ’tragedy’  canadian legislators told an emergency parliamentary session on tuesday night that a rash of suicide attempts by aboriginal teenagers in a remote,   community was ”completely unacceptable” and vowed steps to keep it from happening again.  over the past weekend alone, 11 members of the attawapiskat first nation community in northern ontario tried to kill themselves, prompting the chief to declare a state of emergency. separately, a second group was hospitalized on monday after suicide attempts. the incident shocked the country, even though it is used to tragedies involving its 1. 4 million aboriginals, who largely live in poverty, have a lower life expectancy than other canadians and are more often victims of violent crime. health minister jane philpott said the suicide rates among aboriginal youth were at least 10 times higher than for the general population of young people. aboriginals make up about 4 percent of canada’s population. ”it is a staggering reality, it is completely unacceptable . .. there is nothing more devastating than realizing someone has reached the point of no hope,” she told the emergency debate in the house of commons. ”tonight has to be a turning point for us as a country in order to decide together that we will do better,” she said. canada’s new liberal government said last month it would spend an extra c$8. 37 billion ($6. 54 billion) over five years to help the aboriginal population deal with dire living conditions. in attawapiskat, 28 people attempted suicide in march, some of them adults, health officials said. children as young as 11 were among those who tried to kill themselves during the past few days and police began   patrols in response to the crisis. charlie angus, a federal legislator from the opposition new democrats whose constituency includes attawapiskat, said canada had betrayed its aboriginal youth. ”the greatest tragedy in this nation is that we would waste a generation of children. what squander of potential,” he said. ”we failed them. it has to stop.” the federal government and other authorities have sent 18 additional staff to attawapiskat, including counselors, mental health workers and police. prime minister justin trudeau, who called the suicide attempts ”heartbreaking,” took power last year promising to improve aboriginal living conditions. he did not attend the debate. ’we feel isolated’ the reasons for the attempted suicides are varied, but local leaders point to an underlying despondency and pessimism among their people as well as an increasing number of prescription drug overdoses. living in isolated communities with chronic unemployment and crowded housing, some young aboriginals lack clean water but have easy internet access, giving them a glimpse of affluence in the rest of canada. attawapiskat, 965 km (600 miles) north of ottawa on james bay, is only accessible by plane or winter ice road.   ”we feel isolated   we don’t feel part of the rest of the world,” said grand chief sheila north wilson of manitoba keewatinowi okimakanak, who represents 30 aboriginal communities. attawapiskat, which has 2, 000 people and is near a diamond mine, has declared five states of emergency since 2006. it  previously sounded the alarm over flooding and raw sewage issues, poor drinking water and a housing crisis.  declaring a state of emergency is a symbolic move and does not legally oblige ottawa to take action, said a government spokeswoman. the problems plaguing aboriginals gained prominence in january when a gunman killed four people in la loche, saskatchewan. an aboriginal teenager was charged in the shootings. legislators complained during the debate that ottawa had not yet delivered all the extra aid it had promised la loche. another canadian aboriginal community in the western province of manitoba reported six suicides in two months and 140 suicide attempts in two weeks. ”an individual attempt at suicide is bad enough itself, but if there seems to be a group thing, it’s even more cause for alarm,” said national chief perry bellegarde of the assembly of first nations, canada’s main aboriginal political group. in 2011, the u. n. special rapporteur for indigenous people said he was ”deeply concerned” about living conditions in attawapiskat. resident jackie   whose teenage niece committed suicide last autumn, said it was the third attempt for one    girl who survived on saturday. she said the girl had been challenged to kill herself on social media. in cross lake, manitoba, dozens of people, many of them youths, have attempted suicide this year, said community health director helga hamilton. in some cases, teenagers talked about group suicide before trying to kill themselves separately. ($1=$1. 28 canadian)  (additional reporting by alastair sharp, ethan lou and andrea hopkins in toronto; editing by grant mccool and peter cooney) united nations the united states warned on wednesday that it was ready to use force ”if we must” to stop north korea’s nuclear missile program but said it prefers global diplomatic action against pyongyang for its test launch of an intercontinental ballistic missile (icbm). caracas the venezuelan police officer who staged a helicopter attack on government buildings in caracas last week appeared in an internet video on wednesday vowing to continue fighting for the ”liberation” of his country.

bathroom stop on route 66. flyover territory.  this dynamic now applies to kevin durant in light of monday’s announcement that he will end a frustrating tenure with the oklahoma city thunder in order to pursue a title with a golden state warriors team that recently bested the only healthy playoff team okc has had since the 2012 finals. ••• if the 20th century was rough on the sooner state, the young 21st century had been shaping up unbelievably kindly. an oil and gas industry that had teetered on the verge of collapse for decades experienced a resurgence thanks to the advent of hydraulic fracturing (more commonly referred to as “fracking”) turning ghost towns into hubs replete with hotels and outback steakhouses. flush with cash, a team of oklahoma city energy billionaires purchased the nba’s seattle supersonics in 2006 under strict conditions not to move the team, a policy that was soon to be reversed.  dizzy at the windfall, oklahomans packed the ford center to watch exciting young players like russell westbrook, serge ibaka, james harden, and durant. seemingly overnight, the most common conversation encountered by oklahomans abroad ceased to be, “you’re from oklahoma? i’ve seen your musical. ” clayton dorris, a digital marketer with oklahoma city’s bigwing interactive, noted that, “it didn’t matter which part of the world i was visiting, a mention of being from oklahoma would elicit ‘oh, kevin durant! ’” to hear oklahomans speak of the early days of the franchise is to hear variations on a singular sentiment: in contrast to other middling plains states, the presence of a sports franchise filled with     talent leant oklahoma a sense of cultural validation. kids around the world donned okc’s signature blue and orange.    economies are cyclical and residents understand this. what’s different about the 2016 cycle, however, is that this time the entire fraught dynamic of prosperity, promise and collapse has found expression in the words and actions of a single person: durant. ••• with few exceptions, american popular culture is created on the coasts and trickles inland into the obscure places that serve as sacrificial spaces necessary to maintain the rest of the country. a genuinely american fear of living and working in obscurity drives the young and upwardly mobile from these places where culture is often preserved rather than created, preventing change and permeating communities with   humility. the feeling of locational inadequacy is especially palpable in prairie towns where, as my grandfather, a born and bred okie, put it: “people shower after work, not before. ” equally strong is the relief that arises within citizens once their overlooked home receives national recognition.  in oklahoma’s case, the seeds of resurgence grew out of tragedy. tired of the city’s status as rundown   oklahoma city officials began attempts at revitalizing the capital’s depressed downtown depot in the wake of the oklahoma city bombing, and by 1998 the area  —   dubbed bricktown  —   had become a pristine entertainment district. seemingly overnight, oklahoma city had acquired the amenities people in places like dallas take for granted or even mock: chain restaurants, retail shopping, places to host bachelor parties.  the second indication that oklahoma was to enjoy a cultural ascendance came about as a result of hurricane katrina. in the storm’s aftermath, the nba sought a temporary home for the displaced hornets, and oklahoma city seemed like a natural destination, boasting an   arena and the kind of sports fans that seem to exist exclusively in     places. despite a dismal . 470 win percentage during the hornets’ tenure in okc, local support was ravenous, prompting     chris paul to tell the houston chronicle that playing in oklahoma gives “you get the feeling you’re part of something special”.  david stern and company took note, and  —   with chesapeake executives clay bennett and aubrey mcclendon already in talks to purchase the supersonics  —   the nba brass began working to get a team into a hungry market. the bond between durant and his new city wasn’t immediate, but oklahomans fell for the lanky superstar, who seemed as unassuming of his physical resources as the state itself. in 2013, when durant donated $1m to relief efforts in the wake of a devastating ef5 tornado that cut a   swath of destruction through suburban oklahoma city, his status as local hero was cemented. according to o alan noble, a professor at oklahoma baptist university and contributor to the atlantic, “there’s no question that kd represented more than basketball to oklahoma. between   …     all the local work he did and his vocal identification with the city as his home   …     many people can’t think of oklahoma city without thinking of kevin durant. he gave us something to be proud of and enjoy through economic downturns and natural disasters. we were proud that he played for our city and we were grateful to be able to be his fans. his attitude felt oklahoman. quiet, but confident. kind, but deadly. ” it was likely this attachment that led durant to repeatedly state that he wasn’t a someone who looks for shortcuts to success. a recently unearthed 2010 durant tweet is emblematic of his rhetoric: “now everybody wanna play for the heat and the lakers? let’s go back to being competitive and going at these peoples. ”  to citizens of a state whose economic   had so often been rocked by tough decisions and esoteric global trends, this was especially reassuring. ••• fracking money brought a professional sports franchise to oklahoma, but oil and gas money are certainly not new to the region. though the area was initially dismissed as “indian territory,” federal interest in the land renewed in the 1890s with the discovery of vast amounts of crude petroleum waiting to be drilled beneath what is now oklahoma city. oklahoma’s 1907 statehood occurred within a decade of the territory’s first producing well. the subsequent story of the state is a story of peaks and valleys. there was the original statehood oil boom that lasted throughout the 1920s and then the dust bowl exodus that drove thousands to california. following two more diminishing   cycles, a variety of factors cinched demand to the extent that the number of new producing wells in oklahoma reached lows in the late 1990s not seen since statehood. unfortunately, attempts to solve this problem would inadvertently create many others. the ticket out of the late 90s oil crisis, according to chesapeake energy   mcclendon, lay in the use of fracking  —   a controversial technique that transformed previously unreachable shale deposits into drillable real estate. mcclendon was right: new technologies for obtaining oil and gas changed the industry in a variety of unintended ways.  these methods revitalized american oil, but also lowered the amount of capital required to drill, which removed a significant barrier to the industry for many startups and gave a previously excluded segment of the population a shot at the action. historically high oil prices began to incentivize increased drilling investment just before the thunder came to town. new companies began to change the way business was done, borrowing heavily to purchase equipment and thereby capitalize on the influx of newly reachable, unprecedentedly profitable oil and gas. the problem is that this type of   business model almost never works out in the long run.   drilling enterprises quickly felt the strain of debt, struggling to repay loans on rapidly depreciating drilling equipment. as new ventures began under this aggressive model, the market flooded with oil, prices plummeted, and companies suddenly had to produce twice as much in order to make payments on equipment, further exacerbating the surplus. an era of stable supply and demand had been thrown out of whack, angering opec, which subsequently slashed oil prices in order to flush out american fracking upstarts and protect its historically powerful selling position. per barrel prices reached historic lows. this imbalance between supply and demand tore into oklahoma, where the workforce has become disproportionately involved in energy. on the one hand, major players in the american industry shut off wells, sending workers home indefinitely while waiting for demand to rebound. on the other, heavily leveraged upstarts succumbed to the unsustainability of their business model, with many oklahoma ventures closing shop. residents who had experienced a recent surge in the value of their labor now found themselves sitting at home without a paycheck or other viable career options.  the ramifications of the downturn have been brutal: oklahoma’s economy was the worst or second worst in the nation throughout  . sales tax revenues subsequently plummeted to   lows as 11, 300 jobs disappeared within a   span, including nearly a fifth of mcclendon’s chesapeake energy corporation’s 2, 500 oklahoma city employees. oklahoma now faces a $1. 3bn budget shortfall, leading to a   23. 6% drop in   education funding and deep cuts to law enforcement. while it’s not like the sharpshooting forward killed off the energy industry, the fact remains that durant played his final game in oklahoma city during a season in which even basic tasks like funding education seem impossible, before heading for an infamously cosmopolitan destination. for those marooned back on the plains without work, the cruel tidiness of the narrative continues to sink in. ••• while the basketball implications of durant’s departure are clear enough  —   okc is losing a former league mvp  —   the organizational prospects may be even darker. the prosperity that enabled bennett and mcclendon’s (imaginatively named) professional basketball club llc to move the team in the first place has dissipated, leaving behind a state in which bridges crumble and public schools operate only four days per week. franchise founder aubrey mcclendon died in march after crashing his car into a wall hours after prosecutors announced intentions to indict the owner on charges of conspiracy to suppress land prices. within hours of the crash, crass speculation began, with some locals arguing that the energy tycoon took his own life after federal investigations revealed mcclendon’s financial situation to be eroding. conventional wisdom holds that these ownership difficulties could compound the thunder front office’s troubles in the wake of durant’s departure, leaving the franchise on shakier footing than fans realize. whether or not this is true, it is no stretch to say that okc’s value as a small market franchise has been thus far inflated by general manager sam presti’s preternatural ability to draft undervalued talent, and that in the absence of bankable new superstars, the city may not be as able to sustain a rebuilding period as larger markets.  others have pointed to presti’s penchant for dealing players in trades before they leave for nothing in unrestricted free agency, arguing that the thunder gm will now lean even more heavily on the strategy of at least getting something back for exiting players in light of durant’s (arguably) duplicitous departure. this makes recent reports of westbrook’s unwillingness to extend his time in okc all the more disconcerting for thunder fans. what if a spurned presti calls westbrook’s bluff the way he called james harden’s in 2012? worse, what if westbrook, like durant, initially communicates a desire to stay only to be seduced by a sexier city with immediate title hopes, leaving the thunder with nothing? if any one of those worst case scenarios coincide with continued difficulties for bennett’s energy holdings, there’s a small chance that oklahoma city might not have a team at all in the future.  ••• what stings fans most about monday’s news is the realization that despite all appearances, they had not, in fact, found a kindred spirit, someone with whom they could weather the floods, tornados and   earthquakes. perhaps this was an unfair assumption for fans to make in the first place, and one that surely seems quaint and naïve to those on the outside, but it was the dominant local perception. o alan noble doesn’t blame fans, noting an inherent contradiction: “what draws fans is when they can identify with a player. but it’s also a business, and players have the right and responsibility to make the best decision for themselves. we can’t have it both ways. if the nba wants to encourage a tight bond between local fans and a player, we should expect those fans to be hurt when the player makes a decision that is good for himself but not that community. ”  for his part, durant eagerly leaned into his role as signifier of state values, tweeting criticism when players left small markets to join other superstars and emphasizing loyalty in multiple interviews. his decision to join the warriors comes as a contradiction of a decade worth of  . predictably, the enthusiasm that once led oklahomans to describe durant as representative of the state’s homegrown work ethic has turned to bemusement and even rage (for instance) at what is locally perceived, fairly or not, as a decision to abandon oklahoma for the ‘easy way out,’ a guaranteed shot at a title with a team located close to america’s most   gold mine  —   silicon valley (even if oakland itself has its own economic problems). while durant could probably have won a governor’s race in oklahoma, his status in oakland may more closely resemble that of historical footnote to golden state’s continued success  —   a versatile scorer who helped revitalize an   team (think clyde drexler in houston, 1995). rather than having the hopes of an entire state resting on his shoulders, it’s possible that the absence of messianic pressure is actually one aspect of what helped lure him to golden state in the first place. after all, the man never asked to become a signifier of statewide success for three million people.  meanwhile, oklahomans remain unable to control their state’s destiny, weathering one more in a long line of letdowns as a result of financial concerns that leave citizens beholden to state governments and corporate whims. the sense one gets when discussing the implications of durant’s departure with residents is that they’re saddened by oklahoma’s inability to hold on to good things. they’re frustrated by the outsized financial and cultural pressures that drive prosperity out of the center of the country and toward the coast. oklahomans loved the way the presence of an nba superstar made their state matter to people who had only ever flown over it. and while they begrudgingly respect durant’s decision from a labor v management perspective, they’re blown away by the departure monday’s news represents from the image and ethos he spent a decade cultivating, an ethos so many bought uncritically took at face value.  perhaps saddest of all for those reflecting on the ups and downs of the past eight years is that residents of the sooner state are once again left to kick themselves for buying lines that were too good to be true while they pick up the pieces. for better or worse, kevin durant had come to serve as the last vestige of a brief era of prosperity. likewise, basketball had been an oddly reliable outlet for catharsis in a community whose citizens seem to suffer more than their fair share of hardship. so while it is inevitably tempting to sneer and wonder what could cause otherwise functional adults to shed tears over basketball, it’s worth remembering that oklahomans are, in so many ways, mourning much more than basketball.',\n",
       " 'vince foster was my brother. donald trump should be ashamed.    the writer served on the federal trade commission from 1997 to 2003.      it is beyond contempt that a politician would use a family tragedy to further his candidacy, but such is the character of donald trump displayed in his recent comments to the washington post. in this interview, trump cynically, crassly and recklessly insinuated that my brother, vincent w. foster jr. may have been murdered because “he had intimate knowledge of what was going on” and that hillary clinton may have somehow played a role in vince’s death. how wrong. how irresponsible. how cruel. “there are people who continue to bring it up because they think it was absolutely a murder,” trump said in response to a question about vince’s death.   the subject of clinton white house deputy counsel vince foster’s death should not ”be part of the campaign,” gop candidate donald trump told reporters in bismarck, n. d. may 26. trump had earlier told the washington post there was something ”very fishy” about foster’s death. (reuters)   trump was canny enough to hedge  —   he’s not the one raising questions, he said, but others have. he noted that vince “knew everything that was going on, and then all of a sudden he committed suicide. ” the circumstances of vince’s death, he observed, were “very fishy” and the theories about possible foul play “very serious. ”  this is scurrilous enough coming from   political operatives who have peddled conspiracy theories about vince’s death for more than two decades. how could this be coming from the presumptive republican nominee for president?  five investigations, including by independent counsels robert b. fiske jr. and kenneth starr, concluded that vince suffered from severe depression that caused him to be unable to sleep, unable to work, unable to think straight, and finally to take his own life. i know this to be true because vince lived with me when he came to washington to serve as deputy counsel to the president. this is a grueling job in any administration, especially so at the start, and in the case of the clinton white house, the counsel’s office  —   and vince  —   were consumed with problems, including over the firing of employees in the white house travel office. vince and i were very close siblings  —   i was the older, by four years and two months  —   and there was not much we didn’t share with one another. after about three months, his family rented out their little rock home and vince moved with them to a small georgetown house. vince called me at my office in the justice department a few days before he died. he told me he was battling depression and knew he needed help. but he was worried that such an admission would adversely affect his   security clearance and prevent him from doing his job. i told him i would try to find a psychiatrist who could help him and protect his privacy. after a few phone calls, i gave him three names. that list was found in his wallet with his body at fort marcy park in mclean. i did not see a suicide coming, yet when i was told that vince was dead i knew that he had killed himself. never for a minute have i doubted that was what happened.             caption   the republican candidate continues to dominate the presidential contest.  may 29, 2016 republican presidential candidate donald trump arrives to address the rolling thunder motorcycle rally in washington. jonathan    ',\n",
       " 'was a va. firefighter humiliated by co-workers online before she killed herself?  the trolls were horrid to her while she was alive. and they continued to be awful after her death. fairfax county firefighter nicole mittendorff, 31, killed herself in virginia’s shenandoah national park, the state medical examiner concluded. but even after the search for her was over, her body was identified and memorial candles began to burn, the cyberbullies  —   who claimed they were her fellow firefighters  —   kept scorching away at mittendorff online.  petula is a columnist for the washington post’s local team who writes about homeless shelters, gun control, high heels, high school choirs, the politics of parenting, jails, abortion clinics, mayors, modern families, strip clubs and gas prices, among other things. view archive   facebook google+ rss   if these trolls are actually members of her firehouse family, then mittendorff becomes another example of a new form of workplace harassment. instead of happening in the office, it happens publicly online.  there is an investigation at mittendorff’s firehouse to find out who posted the vicious online attacks and whether they played a role in her suicide.  “we at fairfax fire and rescue are aware of the posts and are looking into the matter. i assure you that my department can not and will not tolerate bullying of any kind,” fairfax county fire chief richard bowers wrote in a public statement saturday. “we will thoroughly investigate this matter and take any appropriate actions needed. ”   fairfax county fire chief richard bowers said he has ”zero tolerance” for bullying after online postings raise questions about whether firefighter nicole mittendorff was bullied before her death. mittendorf’s body was found in virginia’s shenandoah national park last week. (wusa 9)    [searchers find body thought to be missing fairfax firefighter]   mittendorff’s case offers a chilling window into the persistent harassment women encounter on a daily basis online and at work. in fact, those two forms of ugliness appear to be merging. it means sexual harassment isn’t just   bosses pawing at a secretary or men disparaging female   at the water cooler. it can happen from a home computer and devastate a woman’s reputation and career. “it seems to be a newer thing, doing this online,” said angela hughes, a baltimore county fire captain who is also president of the international association of women in fire and emergency medical services. “cyberbullying on   outlets is a new form of harassment. ” her group gets frequent requests for help from firefighters who believe they are being harassed, threatened or mistreated because of their gender. but recently, the group has seen more online bullying, including some facebook pages that actively harass female firefighters. the problem, she said, is that a firehouse fosters a culture of toughness, of not needing help. and too often, harassment goes on because it’s against the culture to ask for help. online harassment gets directed at   women on social media and by online commenters all the time. the women of wgn, a local television station in chicago, recently took on their abusers when they read some of the nastiest emails, tweets and facebook posts  —   attacks on their weight, their voices, their faces. “keep shoving food down that   of yours,” morning anchor robin baumgarten said, quoting one message. “it shuts up that annoying donkey braying noise you make when you talk. ”  [broadcasters read their rudest comments online]  and we’ve seen it in gamergate, where women in the   world are continually blasted online. that scandal started with feminist   reviewer anita sarkeesian, who had to cancel a university speaking engagement two years ago because one of her many persistent and vulgar online harassers threatened a mass shooting if she spoke. and recently it included zoe quinn, a   developer who was smeared online with death threats and lurid details about her sex life by other gamers and an   who didn’t like her game. from a to z, they get hazed. i know. i am on the receiving end of the onslaught daily. here’s a gem i got during a week when i wrote about a neighborhood bone marrow drive and planned parenthood: “hey petula, you [profanity] ugly [profanity],” he wrote in a facebook message. “too bad your mother did not have an abortion. ” i googled him. he’s an older income tax specialist living on long island who likes to post inspirational quotes and pictures of himself on his facebook page. he’s not a   just a   jerk trying to humiliate me for what i do for a living. this brand of workplace harassment operates outside the world of those surveys, workshops and seminars that company lawyers make everyone take, which do nothing to reduce sexism, but only exist to thwart lawsuits in case a caveman boss demands sex for a promotion. even if the trolls ripping mittendorff apart online didn’t work with her, those posts were up there to shame her for her career choice and belittle her within her career. this subversive yet simultaneously very public sexual harassment is becoming increasingly common. a pew research center survey in 2014 found that 1 in 4 young women has been stalked online  —   and about as many have been sexually harassed or physically threatened. we know women still face    harassment in   fields: the military, law enforcement, science, the tech sector. even the women who work for the national park service have offered horror stories. and it’s especially prevalent in firefighting, where i found case after case  —   in rhode island, arizona, utah, florida  —   of women winning sexual harassment cases against their departments in just the past couple of years. in federal reports, congressional testimony, courtroom testimony, personal essays and formal complaints, we hear the same story. women continue to be harassed, belittled, passed over and manipulated by their male   or bosses. and those happened on the job. what happens online? too often, women get told to just “ignore those guys, they’re losers anyhow” or “it’s online, what do you care?” or to “shake it off. ” nope. it matters, it hurts, it means something. and it has to stop. i’d say, “ask nicole mittendorff how this feels. ” but we can’t. twitter: @petulad   read more petula dvorak:   harriet tubman will be on the $20 bill but still doesn’t rate a statue in the capitol    a black woman in the senate: ‘when she sits there, we all sit there.’   a maryland lawmaker raped as a child can’t get his bill for sex assault survivors passed.   the obamas: refusing to give in to the haters after years of threats and abuse   the ‘trump effect’ is contaminating our kids  —   and could resonate for years  ',\n",
       " 'indian immigrants rethink the american dream  (cnn) srinivas kuchibhotla, shot to death last month in a kansas bar, shared a dream with many other indians i know. his widow described it on facebook a few days after his killing: ”we built our dream home, which he painted, and installed the garage door,” wrote sunayana dumala. ”doing any kind of work on his home gave him immense joy. this was the home that he had built . .. for us and any kids we would have. (it was) our first step to starting our family.  ”it’s so unfortunate that this dream of ours is now shattered.” my heart broke when i read her words.  that was the american dream she was talking about. the ideal that everyone in this country has an equal opportunity to achieve success and prosperity. many indians hail from humble beginnings in their homeland and live by one decree: work hard because in america, you can be what you want to be. my own family shared the dream and when i graduated from college, my father told me to think big. he knew what i had not fully realized yet that as an indian woman, the doors to achievement were wider in this country than in my homeland    and  perhaps anywhere else.  but now, under attack because of their identity, indians see the dream fading. kuchibhotla was a young engineer from hyderabad and came to the united states for a good job. he was having a beer with a friend near his home in olathe when the shooter approached him, told him to ”get out of my country” and gunned him down. a few days later, another indian man, deep rai, was shot outside his home in kent, washington. his attacker yelled: ”go back to your country.” rai is expected to recover. the fbi is investigating both incidents as hate crimes.  the south asian or ”desi” diaspora reacted with obvious horror. what’s been called a  ”wave of   sentiment” has dominated the news in india and added to fear that was already simmering after the 2016 election and rhetoric against immigrants. ”i can tell you a majority of indian parents . .. want their children back in india,” said mithra amaran, who also lives in olathe.  amaran has spent 35 years in the united states. she told me she fears for the lives of her sons, both born and raised in this country. her younger son works in mexico, and amaran feels he is safer in guadalajara than in kansas. ”they are young brown people and i worry about them constantly,” she said. when i went home to kolkata last december, i heard friends and family talk about how happy they were to have returned home. or relieved that a son or daughter had chosen a college in europe or the middle east, instead of america.  author sandip roy, also a native kolkatan, wrote recently in the new york times that indians no longer hold the aspiration of finding success in america. one reason is that india has experienced tremendous economic growth and opened up to the world. but another is a diminished image of the united states. roy mentioned a friend’s cousin’s wedding that was called off because the bride did not want to move with the groom to america. a while ago, i might have read that with utter incredulity. in my youth, a man settled in america was a prized catch. very little else mattered for my girlfriends. life would be set if they could find a husband like that. i hadn’t before heard indians voice these distressing concerns. dumala, in the same facebook post, said it this way: ”do we belong?” she asked. ”is this the same country we dreamed of and is it still secure to raise our families and children here?” sikhs still victims of   hate crimes, a vanishing dream? dumala’s words gave me pause for thought. i hope her question serves as a     call for a community that has not always been totally honest in looking inward.  for too long,   have subscribed to the notion of the ”model minority” immune from racism. as successful entrepreneurs, doctors, lawyers, professors and techies, they live in comfortable   white neighborhoods and focus on getting their kids into harvard and yale. even though the government used to categorize us as ”other,” not all indians saw themselves as such. this, despite the long history of racism and xenophobia in this country that sometimes targeted indians. ”it’s a huge problem,” said journalist and educator rajul punjabi, 32. ”it’s something that’s not talked about at all. now for the first time indians are thinking about race and what black people went through in this country.” socioeconomic status, punjabi told me, can brainwash someone to thinking their skin color does not matter.  another journalist, jennifer chowdhury, 33, told me she has wondered her whole life why indians identify with white people. chowdhury was born to undocumented bangladeshi parents who worked as waiters and housekeepers in new york and were not part of the ”model minority” world. if south asians spoke to each other across class lines, she believes, ”none of this would be such a shock.” marketing professor and blogger gaurav sabnis, 36, added that indians may be guilty themselves of a bit of xenophobia.  ”we don’t like it when we are confused with arabs or people from muslim countries,” he told me. ”we do consider ourselves quasi white.” a lost history of immigration, dark clouds, this is certainly not the first wave of   sentiment in america.  indians began arriving on these shores, primarily in california, in the 19th century, according to the migration policy institute. back then indians were   citizens in their own   country. most who set sail for america were uneducated and unskilled and found jobs working crops and farms. vaishno das bagai was one of them, though he was different from his counterparts. he arrived in san francisco in 1915 with his wife and three young sons, one of the first indians to emigrate with his family. he came because he said he wanted to be free of slavery.  he ran a general store, dressed dapperly in american suits and was naturalized in 1921. but in 1923, the supreme court ruled indians were not white and therefore ineligible for citizenship under the law. bagai had already renounced his british citizenship reapplying would mean certain arrest because of his activism for independence.  bagai became a persona non grata and was subjected to alien laws that, among other things, barred him from owning property. he was forced to sell both his business and his home. the final insult came when, without a passport, he could not visit india. disappointed and humiliated at age 37, bagai gassed himself to death in a san jose hotel room. by then, the immigration acts of 1917 and 1924 had effectively banned asians from entering the united states and virtually ended indian migration.  it wasn’t until president harry truman signed the   bill as part of the immigration act of 1946 that indians could again gain citizenship, own property and vote. the act also established a quota: 100 indians would be allowed into america every year. two decades later, the 1965 immigration act opened the way for indians, including my parents, to settle in america. the act removed   criteria on immigration and put all prospective newcomers on equal footing for access to the united states. in 1960, only 12, 000 indian immigrants lived in this country. today, that number has grown to more than 2. 4 million. and that’s not counting people who arrive with temporary work visas it’s estimated that 70% of the 85, 000 h1b visas handed out annually to highly skilled workers go to indians. nationality, identity and the pledge of allegiance, where ’we all count equally’ the shootings in kansas and washington are dark clouds looming over the dream at the moment.  kuchibhotla’s life was ended by a man who allegedly did not want him here. his widow said that as difficult as it would be for her, she would return to kansas after the funeral to fulfill her husband’s dream. i hope her actions will help other indians to be less fearful.  this week, i thought a lot about the indians who were pioneering immigrants. vaishno das bagai ended his life because he felt he failed at realizing his american dream. he didn’t live to see a place where indians had finally achieved a status other than ”other.” i thought, too, about what we can do to protect the american dream. i sought an answer from bagai’s granddaughter. rani cardona is 61 and identifies as a   girl (her father married a white woman) who was raised in a jewish neighborhood in los angeles and who married a   latino from watts but lived in koreatown.  ”america stood for something once. and we should still stand for it,” she told me.  ”this is the one damn place in the world where we take a stand and say: we all count equally.” she laughed at the idea of the supreme court deciding only white people could be citizens, thinking how much america has progressed since the days when black people had no rights and brown people had few. ”i thought how far we’ve come from being afraid of ’hindoos’ and putting japanese in

       " 'do japanese really work themselves to death? in some cases, yes.   kashiwa, japan  —   in the united states, there’s no end to stories and listicles and books telling you how to work more productively so you can spend more time with your family or doing the things you love. in japan, there’s not even a term for “  balance. ” what there is, though, is a word for “death by overwork. ” it’s “karoshi,” and it’s considered such an inevitable result of japan’s notoriously grueling work culture that it’s hardly even discussed. but every year here, hundreds, maybe thousands, of japanese people literally work themselves to death. kiyotaka serizawa was one of them. a year ago in july, the    killed himself after working crazy hours  —   90 hours a week during the last weeks of his life  —   at a company that does maintenance at apartment buildings. “his colleagues told me that they were amazed how much he worked,” his father, kiyoshi serizawa, said in an interview in their family home. “they said they’d never seen anyone who didn’t even own the company work so hard. ” japan has a working culture where spending long hours at the grindstone, or in compulsory socializing with superiors after work, is the norm. it began in the 1970s, when wages were relatively low and employees wanted to maximize their earnings. it continued through the boom years of the 1980s, when japan became the world’s   economy and everyone was on the juggernaut. and it remained after the bubble burst in the late 1990s, when companies began restructuring and employees stayed at work to try to ensure they weren’t laid off. still, irregular workers  —   who worked without benefits or job security  —   were brought in, making the regular workers toil even harder. now, no one blinks an eyelid at    days.  [ it’s official: japan’s population is dramatically shrinking ]  “in a japanese workplace, overtime work is always there. it’s almost as if it is part of scheduled working hours,” said koji morioka, an emeritus professor at kansai university who is on a committee of experts advising the government on ways to combat karoshi. “it’s not forced by anyone, but workers feel it like it’s compulsory. ” while the basic workweek is 40 hours, many workers don’t put in for extra hours for fear of being given a bad performance evaluation. this has led to the concept of “service overtime”  —   “service” being japanese for “free. ” this relentless schedule has led to karoshi  —   either from a fatal heart attack or stroke, or a suicide triggered by overwork  —   becoming a recognized cause of death. labor ministry figures show that 189 deaths were classified this way last year, although experts think the actual number is in the thousands. karoshi has long been considered a male problem, but advocates say they’re seeing an increasing number of women dying, almost always by killing themselves. the striking thing about them is that they’re very young, often in their 20s, said hiroshi kawahito, a lawyer and   of the national defense counsel for victims of karoshi, which fights for victims’ families. kawahito represented the family of a journalist in her early 30s who died of a heart attack. when a reporter gasped, he added: “it’s actually not rare in japan for people in their early 30s to have heart attacks. ” once a death is classified as karoshi, a victim’s family is automatically entitled to compensation through a kind of workers’ comp system. the number of claims for   cases rose to a record high of 2, 310 in the year ending in march, government figures show. but less than a third of applications are successful  kawahito said. kiyotaka serizawa’s death was officially certified last month. he was a supervisor responsible for overseeing building janitors in three separate locations in this town northeast of tokyo. struggling to keep up, kiyotaka had tried to resign a year before his death, but his boss refused to accept his notice. apparently concerned about inconveniencing his subordinates, he carried on working. he would sometimes stop at his parents’ house to sleep as he drove between offices. “he would lie here on this couch and go into such a deep sleep that i would come and check on him to make sure his heart was still beating,” said his mother, mitsuko serizawa.  [ why japan will pay a big price for britain’s vote to leave the e. u. ]  the last time his mother saw him was july last year, when he came to collect the laundry he’d been too busy to do. he stopped off for 10 minutes and watched some cute cat videos on his phone with his   mother. but then, on july 26, he went missing. three weeks later, his body was found in his car in nagano prefecture, not far from a place where he’d gone on family camping holidays as a child. he’d burned briquettes in his car and died from carbon monoxide poisoning. although karoshi has been a problem for several decades, it was only 18 months ago that the government passed legislation to try to tackle the problem. the act sets specific targets, such as reducing the percentage of employees working for more than 60 hours a week to 5 percent by 2020, from the 8 to 9 percent range recorded in the past few years. the government is also trying to get employees to actually take their paid vacation leave. most japanese workers get 20 days leave a year, but few take even half of that because of a working culture in which taking days off is seen as a sign of slacking or lack of commitment to the job. the government hopes to entice workers to take at least 70 percent of their leave owed. “if you’re conscious of this right, then you can show that there’s nothing wrong with taking time off,” said yasukazu kurio of the ministry of health and labor’s office for the prevention of karoshi. kurio is trying to set a good example: last year he took 17 of his 20 days. kawahito, the lawyer, said that the government’s efforts could have some impact at the margins but that they don’t deal with the fundamental problem. “there’s nothing that’s stated under this act to penalize companies that break the rules,” said kawahito, who’s not exactly a role model for   balance. as a younger lawyer, he used to work long hours, but now that he’s reached the age of 66, he’s cut back to about 60 hours a week. still, he wants to see a law like the european working time directive that stipulates 11 hours off between shifts.  [ japan is trying to save its economy with a jedi mind trick ]  the karoshi problem is exacerbated by the relative weakness of labor unions, which have been primarily concerned with raising wages rather than shortening working hours, and the japanese practice of having a job for life. most university students go into a company or a ministry after graduation with the expectation they’ll be there until they retire. “in a country like the u. s. people have more freedom to move to a company that treats you better,” said kenichi kuroda, a professor at meiji university in tokyo who specializes in labor culture. “but in japan, people tend to stay at one company for life, so it’s difficult for people to move on. ” some companies, especially in the financial sector, are taking the initiative by allowing employees to come in earlier and leave earlier. so instead of working from nine to nine, they’re now working from seven to seven and can be home in time to see their children. “these companies are finding ways to bring about social change, and it could influence other companies by showing how they’re creating a ‘dream lifestyle,’” kuroda said, laughing to show he knew   days would not be considered revolutionary elsewhere. still, the problem is going to be difficult to alleviate. japan’s population is aging rapidly, with the workforce expected to shrink by at least a quarter by 2050. that means even fewer people available to work, increasing the workloads of those who remain. morioka, the professor, said that eliminating death by overwork will mean changing the entire working culture of japan. “it’s impossible to get rid of karoshi alone,” he said. “we need to change the overtime culture and create the time for family and hobbies. long working hours are the root of all evil in japan. people are so busy they don’t even have the time to complain. ”  yuki oda contributed to this report.  read more   japanese entrepreneurs face a special challenge: the ‘wife block’   the post’s view: mr. abe’s big win   faced with few options, japan gives prime minister abe more time to fix the economy     ',\n",
       " '5 road trips to help you explore america’s ghosts, murder in the midwest, and the civil war  it’s fall  —   the perfect time for a road trip.  the roads aren’t yet slippery with ice, the trees are awash in vibrant colors, and the weather is just nippy enough to require a jacket, but not so cold as to require staying indoors.     fall is also a great time to reflect on the nation’s past  —   or, at least, the long march toward winter always puts us in a contemplative mood. you can look back in a number of ways  —   by traveling to civil war battle sites, say, or visiting famous, purportedly “haunted” locations.  so we’ve come up with five road trips  —   one lengthy and four you can complete in a couple of days or even a few hours  —   to spark those autumnal feelings.  get in the car. winter’s on the way. trip 1: creepy new england history with aaron mahnke estimated trip length: 8 hours and 10 minutes. we recommend spreading it over a long weekend.            aaron mahnke is a novelist and the host of lore, a popular podcast that digs into history to find eerie incidents from the past (it’s also being adapted for tv). some of lore’s tales have supposed supernatural roots; others are just creepy things that happened. a new england resident, mahnke provided us with just the right pit stops for a quick, haunted jaunt through some of america’s oldest locations.       stop 1: hadley, massachusetts (lore episode) mary webster wasn’t the most popular woman in hadley. she was shipped off to boston in 1683 to be tried as a witch, but was acquitted. a year later, she was blamed for the mysterious illness that was slowly killing the town hero and elder, philip smith. rather than risk another acquittal in boston, a handful of men from the town took justice into their own hands. they pulled her from her home in the middle of winter and  —   i won’t spoil the surprise. it’s too powerful.    stop 2) north adams, massachusetts (lore episode)             the hoosac tunnel was carved through five miles of mountain in western massachusetts in 1865. there were nearly 200 deaths during the construction, but one event in particular has left its mark. a week after ringo kelly made an error that ended the lives of two   when he mistakenly set a dynamite charge too early, he mysteriously went missing. his body turned up exactly one year later  —   in the same spot where the fatal explosion had occurred. he’d been strangled to death. stop 3) danvers, massachusetts (lore episode) the danvers state hospital was once the pinnacle of modern mental health care, but a century of use and abuse led to its slow decline. built on the hill that once belonged to a cranky salem witch trial magistrate, the hospital quickly earned a reputation for crowded quarters, filthy conditions, and ice pick lobotomies.    the hospital is gone today, but the graveyard is still there, right behind the modern condos that replaced it. the condos, by the way, are built atop the network of old tunnels that once connected the hospital buildings. that’s one basement i have no desire to visit, even if i could.  stop 4) exeter, rhode island (lore episode) on the morning of march 17, 1892, a group of exeter’s townsfolk dug up the graves of three local women. they were looking for the vampire responsible for the deaths of others from town. in the end, they placed the blame on a young woman named mercy brown, and burned her organs right beside her grave in the cemetery.  today, hundreds of vampire lovers visit her grave each year. it’s fitting, some say, for the   woman whose exhumation inspired bram stoker’s seminal novel, dracula. stop 5) freetown, massachusetts (lore episode) marking the southern corner of a mysterious patch of land known as the bridgewater triangle, freetown is full of unusual tales. the local freetown state forest has been home for decades to rumors of dangerous creatures and satanic rituals. the triangle as a whole plays host to more of the same. ships and planes might not disappear inside the borders of the triangle, but the swamps and forests there seem to hold more than their fair share of cold spots, whispering voices, and cursed ledges. enter at your own risk. stop 6) tolland, connecticut (lore episode) when daniel benton built his small, red   home in 1720, he had no idea what sort of visitors it would play host to in the centuries to come. even now, three centuries after its construction, you can still visit and see the grave of benton’s grandson elisha and elisha’s fiancée jemima, who are buried on opposite sides of the driveway.    enjoy your stroll on the quaint new england property around the house, but keep your eyes on the windows. more than a few tourists have seen things they weren’t expecting. specifically, the   lovers.  —   as told to todd vanderwerff trip 2) a civil war journey with tony horwitz estimated trip length: 6 hours, 33 minutes. take this trip over a long weekend.            tony horwitz’s books live in the territory between travelogue and historical document. his confederates in the attic is one of the best books about how the legacy of the civil war continues to mark the country, and his most recent book, midnight rising, follows the story of john brown, the abolitionist whose raid on harpers ferry   the war. a pulitzer winner for his reporting on   workers for the wall street journal and president of the american society of historians, horwitz shared with us his ideal civil war road trip. stop 1) harpers ferry, west virginia the scene of john brown’s raid in 1859 and constant fighting throughout the civil war, harpers ferry is extremely compact, picturesque, and well interpreted by the national park service. it’s one of the best places in america to absorb history and scenery, by foot, in half a day or less. stop 2) antietam battlefield in sharpsburg, maryland             it’s a pleasant   drive into maryland to the battlefield at antietam, site of the bloodiest day of combat in us history.  antietam is the   major battleground in the east, with cornfields,   fences, farmhouses, and other features that closely resemble their appearance in mathew brady’s famous photographs. also, antietam was a   battle, so it’s fairly easy to take in and understand in a few hours.     antietam bonus: it’s just a few miles from shepherdstown, west virginia, a historic college town with nice restaurants, lodging, and shopping. stop 3) a drive through the virginia countryside cross the potomac at brunswick, maryland, and continue south into the rolling piedmont of northern virginia, where the confederate cavalryman john mosby launched his famous raids.  the countryside around towns like aldie, middleburg, upperville, and delaplane is among the most scenic in virginia, a great place for a leisurely few hours’ drive with stops at sites associated with mosby (suggested routes). stop 4) the battlefields of fredericksburg, chancellorsville, spotsylvania, and the wilderness, all in virginia after taking in the scenic countryside, continue south for about an hour to these clustered battlefields.  this area was fought over more than any other in the 1860s, and though much less pristine than antietam, it’s a good place to grasp the scale and horror of civil war combat. rather than try to take in all the battles, choose a few of the most dramatic sites, like the bloody angle at spotsylvania and the stonewall jackson shrine at guinea station, where the rebel icon died after his wounding at chancellorsville. stop 5) richmond, virginia after another hour’s drive south, you’re in richmond, capital of the confederacy and chockablock with civil war museums and memorials (and nearby battlefields, if you haven’t gotten your fill).     some of the best sites: hollywood cemetery, the museum and white house of the confederacy, the murals and museum at the virginia historical society, and the colossal statues along monument avenue in the fan district, a lovely historic neighborhood to tour on foot. richmond bonus: much better soul food and other southern grub than you’ll find farther north in virginia. stop 6) appomattox court house, virginia             lastly, follow lee’s retreat route, a meandering drive of about 100 miles, beginning south of richmond and ending at appomattox court house, where lee surrendered to ulysses s. grant in 1865.  you can follow the story of lee’s retreat on am radio and at waysides along the   rural route. appomattox, a small national historical park that includes the farmhouse where grant and lee met, is an apt and moving place to conclude your civil war tour.    —   as told to caleb lewis trip 3) haunted america with colin dickey estimated trip length: 10 to 14 days            got 10 days to kill? want to drive  ? colin dickey, author of the new book ghostland: an american history in haunted places, is just the man to guide you. dickey’s book posits that many of america’s darkest periods are encoded in our stories of haunted houses and locations.  “i wanted to look at both the ghost stories that we tell and also the kinds of places and houses that get ghost stories attached to them, then the kinds of stories we unveil by unpacking those a little bit,” he says. this is the longest of our trips, but it’s well worth it for fans of american history, or american horror, or both.    stop 1) los angeles, california los angeles has a pretty spectacular collection of haunted hotels, particularly a lot of the famous, lavish hotels downtown la is known for, like the millennium biltmore, or even more modern ones like the bonaventure. there’s also the cecil hotel, which is this rundown place that used to be home to a couple of serial killers. the nice thing about la is there’s a haunted hotel for every budget. but the one i really love is the biltmore  —   it dates to the ’20s and it’s this great, grand old la hotel. it’s where the academy awards were held the first couple of years. most famously, perhaps, it’s the last place where elizabeth short, the black dahlia, was seen alive. she’s probably their most famous ghost.  stop 2) san jose, california go to the winchester house. the story that gets most commonly told is that sarah winchester  —   the    of oliver winchester, who owned the winchester rifle company and introduced the world to the “gun that won the west”  —   moved from new haven, connecticut, out to what were at the time the countries and pastures of california, after a series of deaths in the family.  she bought this farmhouse and over the next couple of decades enlarged it considerably into this massive space with over 161 rooms. some people say she believed she was haunted by the ghosts of anyone who had been killed by a winchester rifle.  that’s the story people tell. the true story  —   which i cover in ghostland  —   is perhaps a little less dramatic and a little less exciting, but what i find so fascinating about that house is that it centers on a woman who lives by herself, who doesn’t remarry, doesn’t have children, and thus becomes somewhat vilified.   stop 3) reno, nevada outside reno, there is a place called the mustang ranch, which is one of the most famous legal brothels in the country and also quite famously haunted by a number of different ghosts.     it was started in the ’70s by a guy named joe conforte, who became friends with a boxer named oscar bonavena. it looked like bonavena was having an affair with conforte’s wife, and bonavena was shot and killed in the parking lot one day. according to   shows, he is now haunting the mustang ranch.  depending on your price point and your interest, you don’t need to spend too much time at the mustang ranch. they do have a little restaurant there, where you can have a nice meal.  stop 4) estes park, colorado             the stanley hotel is a pretty spectacular hotel set in some really beautiful mountains.  it’s perhaps most   for being the inspiration for stephen king’s book the shining.  king and his wife checked in to the stanley hotel on the last night of its regular operating season before the winter. they had the hotel entirely to themselves. they ate dinner in a lavish ballroom with music coming from nowhere. that was the night that he got the idea for the book.  honestly, when you hear stories of ghosts at the stanley hotel, they sound a lot like those that appeared in the stanley kubrick film based on the book  —   people in tuxedos and ball gowns wandering down the halls. did the ghosts create the movie, or did the movie create the ghosts? stop 5) st. louis, missouri the next fun stop would be the lemp mansion, where you can spend the night in addition to having dinner in a creepy dining room.     the lemp family were a brewing empire in the 19th century. they were one of the first families to bring german beer to the country, and they made a vast fortune.  but in the early 20th century, the lemps suffered a series of disasters. the patriarch killed himself in 1904, so the business fell to his son, who was not good at business and couldn’t weather prohibition, which killed the company. he killed himself in 1922. another brother would go on to shoot himself in 1929, along with one of their sisters, who died under somewhat mysterious circumstances  —   pretty clearly suicidal, though not conclusively  —   also in the ’20s.  this family that represented the kind of          american success story became overwrought with despondency, despair, and depression in two short decades. the house now gives regular ghost tours, and it’s believed by many to be haunted by the various lemps.  stop 6) moundsville, west virginia             we’ve been going from lavish place to lavish place, so get yourself to the   moundsville penitentiary, often labeled as one of the most haunted prisons in the country.  it’s a really daunting affair, built out of these   stones with turrets that make it look like a medieval fortress. it was built at a time when the idea was to make the building itself seem gloomy and melancholic so the prisoner would arrive at prison with this sense of foreboding and despair, and that was part of the punishment.  it was functioning until the early ’90s; through much of the 20th century, it was operating at three to four times its operating capacity and was an absolute horror show. you had terrible overcrowding situations that were civil rights violations that went up to the west virginia supreme court, with prisoners arguing that the conditions were cruel and inhumane.     a lot of the hauntings, as you might imagine, come from this environment of extreme deprivation and degradation of the laws. i think of moundsville as an example of ghost stories that arise out of our own neglect and shame.  moundsville’s name actually comes from grave creek mound, one of the largest native american burial grounds in the country, and it’s literally across the street from the penitentiary. it’s this massive hill that rises about 100 feet from the ground, and it was built by the adena people, of whom we know very, very little. it, too, has an eerie vibe about it. the two sites, the prison and the mound, look at each other across the street. stop 7: salem, massachusetts salem is the home of the salem witch trials, but also the house of the seven gables, which is the house that was owned at one point by the aunt of nathaniel hawthorne and from whom he got the inspiration to write the novel of the same name, which itself is one of our earliest books about a haunted house.  in the book, the idea is that one of the witches, before she is executed, has cursed the future owner of the house, so the house itself is cursed by this injustice.  the house itself is, as you might imagine, reported to be haunted, although the staff itself seems to downplay the hauntedness. that’s in contrast to the rest of the town, where there’s a tourist industry built around salem’s past. the house of the seven gables tries to be a bit more stately.   —   as told to katie hicks trip 4: a tour of midwestern murder with todd vanderwerff estimated trip length: 3 to 5 days            vox’s critic at large todd vanderwerff grew up in the great plains of the american midwest, and he really won’t shut up about it. here’s a   eerie trip for those who like empty spaces.    stop 1: cleveland, ohio you have two possible points of interest here. the first is the story of bay village’s sam sheppard, a doctor first convicted (in 1954) then acquitted (in 1966) of killing his wife, marilyn. (sam sheppard was the basis for the fugitive.) a circus of a trial was found to have contributed to his conviction, and whoever killed marilyn sheppard has never been found. the cleveland police museum will set up a presentation on the trial, by request. or you can just visit the museum’s exhibit on the “torso murderer,” a   serial killer active in the 1930s who left behind mutilated (you guessed it) torsos. seven and zodiac director david fincher has long been rumored to be making a film about the unsolved mystery, but it has yet to materialize. stop 2: bath township, michigan             bath township is site of the deadliest school massacre in history, perpetrated by the school board treasurer, andrew kehoe. in may 1927, kehoe, angry at a series of professional and economic failures, first killed his wife at home, and then used explosives to blow up both his property and one wing of the local school, killing 38.  he then drove his truck up to the site and blew it up, killing both himself and several bystanders.   people died in total, with 58 injured. a museum on the deaths is located in the local middle school. stop 3: chicago, illinois there’s plenty of spooky stuff to see in chicago, but your best bet is to explore the history of h. h. holmes, perhaps america’s most prolific serial killer. he built a massive “murder castle” for young women to stay in during the 1893 world’s fair  —   and many of those women were never seen again. the book devil in the white city brought him to greater prominence. a few remnants of the murder castle remain, but instead of trying to explore them yourself, i recommend taking one of several guided tours dedicated to holmes.    stop 4: plainfield, wisconsin the town of plainfield isn’t exactly pleased with being the former home of murderer ed gein, convicted of the death of two women (in 1954 and 1957) but also of digging up graves and littering his property with the remains, so you might have to organize your own tour. gein inspired several iconic cinematic killers  —   including psycho’s norman bates and the texas chainsaw massacre’s leatherface.  stop 5: mankato, minnesota mankato is the site of the largest mass execution in american history, which happened on december 26, 1862. the military hanged 38 native americans for their part in the 1862 dakota war, which was fought over the government’s breaking of treaties. (in this case, “dakota” refers to the tribe the hanged men belonged to.) originally, 303 were sentenced to death, but abraham lincoln exonerated 265. stop 6: villisca, iowa             unlike many small towns that have been home to horrific murders, villisca has embraced the events of june 1912, when an entire family of six  —   and two additional kids staying over with one of the children  —   was murdered with an axe while they slept. the killer covered the faces of his victims after the murders were committed, and later sat down at the kitchen table for a bite to eat before slipping out the door just before dawn. he or she was never caught.  not only can you visit a museum in the home where the murders happened, but you can  —   for a hefty fee  —   spend the night there, should you so desire. stop 7: labette county, kansas complete your tour of midwestern murder by visiting the site of the former home of the bender family, better known as the “bloody benders. ” the four benders  —   who said they were a family but probably weren’t related  —   set up a small countryside inn for those traveling westward in the 1870s, and while “daughter” kate entertained the guests, another family member would bash in the guest’s head with a hammer. then the guest’s throat would be slit and the body dumped through a trapdoor into the cellar. the benders escaped just as word of their deeds made it out into the general public, and though rumors of sightings (or capture) have floated ever since, nothing definitive has ever been proved. they simply seemed to vanish.    trip 5) day trips of the weird with lauren katz estimated trip length: any of these locations will take up a few hours of your time. driving time depends on where you live. vox writer lauren katz has made a hobby of visiting museums, national historic sites, and other places of interest. we asked her to list some of the weirdest and spookiest she knows of, for those of you who might not have time for a road trip but could get away for an afternoon. day trip 1: bodie state historic park, bridgeport, ca bodie is as good as ghost towns get. a mining town from the 1800s, it’s now in a state of “arrested decay. ” there’s an eerie desert silence as you walk around what was once home to about 10, 000 people in the middle of the hills that lie north of mono lake. peer into homes, stores, and a schoolhouse with everything left in exactly the same place as it was when bodie was a working town.  day trip 2: winchester mystery house, san jose, ca             even if you can’t make time for the longer “haunted america” trip above, the winchester mystery house is still worth a day trip if you’re passing through northern california. sarah winchester, the heiress to the winchester rifle fortune, oversaw    construction of this house from 1884 until her death in 1922. doors open to nowhere, and stairs stop  . be sure to check out the seance room.   day trip 3: mütter museum, philadelphia, pa  president grover cleveland’s jaw tumor, the tallest skeleton on display in north america, and einstein’s brain are all among the highlights of this bizarre medical history museum. the museum’s stated mission is to help the public “understand the mysteries and beauty of the human body and to appreciate the history of diagnosis and treatment of disease. ” whether you’re a student of medical history or just delightfully grossed out by organs preserved in jars, you’ll likely find something of interest.   day trip 4: edgar allan poe national historic site, philadelphia, pa               a handful of cities claim edgar allan poe as their own, but this house in philadelphia  —   the only one still standing of his many residences during the six years he spent in the city  —   is where he wrote some of his most famous, unnerving work. the furnishings are rather sparse, but a trip down to the basement, eerily reminiscent of the one described in poe’s short story “the black cat,” is enough to send chills through your entire body.  day trip 5: salem village witchcraft victims’ memorial, danvers, ma the salem witch trials of 1692 and 1693 took the lives of at least 19 people. but while they are most associated with salem itself (obviously) the infamous period actually began in the neighborhood of salem village  —   now danvers, massachusetts.  a memorial to the victims, which was dedicated in 1992, sits directly across from the site of the original meetinghouse where many of the executions took place. it’s worth a visit on its own, or as part of a stop in danvers during the “creepy new england history” trip above.

       " 'book excerpt: beyond words, judge donald trump by his actions - breitbart one issue that many wonder about is [donald trump’s] apparent lack of empathy. [the public spotlight has shone for decades upon his business career and his place in the entertainment world, which is why we often miss the empathetic side of him that many doubt exists. remember that he spent seven years remorselessly firing people on a television program, and this “reality television” show largely imprinted the image that we regard today as the real donald trump.  but it was also donald trump who took jennifer hudson under his wing when her mother, brother, and nephew were gunned down in chicago, offering her a free apartment at trump tower while she grieved. she was never charged for her stay and was able to feel safe. in 1988, trump helped    andrew ten, a boy who needed to fly to new york for special medical attention. the airline refused to let him board the plane because of his bulky medical equipment. trump was informed of the issue and immediately sent his private jet to take the boy to new york. in 1986, a woman named annabell hill was in danger of losing her family farm. her husband had committed suicide in the misguided hope that his life insurance policy settlement would make their farm solvent. trump heard about this woman’s plight and offered enough financial help to make sure she could keep her farm, which had been in the hill family for three generations. after being arrested at the mexican border with weapons in his car in 2013, marine vet andrew tahmooressi spent seven months in a mexican prison, where he was beaten and chained to a bed. when he was released, trump sent him a check for $25, 000 to help get him back on his feet. darnell barton was driving his bus across a bridge when he spotted a woman preparing to jump. he stopped the bus, approached the woman, and convinced her not to take her own life that day. when trump heard about the story, he sent barton $10, 000, commenting, “i thought that was so beautiful to see. i think he is a great guy with an amazing heart and i said that man should be rewarded. ” contrary to popular media belief, donald trump actually has a long history of helping others, as evidenced by ivanka trump in her rnc speech: over the years, on too many occasions to count, i saw my father tear stories out of the newspaper about people whom he had never met, who were facing some injustice or hardship. he’d write a note to his assistant, in a signature black felt tip pen, and request that the person be found and invited to trump tower to meet with him. he would talk to them and then draw upon his extensive network to find them a job or get them a break. and they would leave his office, as people so often do after having been with donald trump, feeling that life could be great again. because of trump’s innate generosity and empathy, he will likely listen to all americans, not just his base (he has already begun to do so) and make intelligent decisions —  though the bluntness and forcefulness of his speech may lead some to believe otherwise. time and again, trump has displayed his innate generosity. his expressions of empathy, particularly those expressed through financial gifts, seem unusually generous when compared to those of most national public office holders. and, lest you think it is because congressional members are not wealthy, remember that the washington post educated us on the matter in october of 2012: most members weathered the financial crisis better than the average american, who saw median household net worth drop 39 percent from 2007 to 2010. the median estimated wealth of members of the current congress rose 5 percent during the same period, according to their reported assets and liabilities. the wealthiest   of congress gained 14 percent. whether he is helping families in need or recognizing small acts of heroism or kindness, it’s clear that donald listened and lives in accordance with the idea that “to whom much is given, much will be required. ” in the same way, he will likely listen to americans and make intelligent decisions —  though the bluntness and forcefulness of his persona may lead some to believe otherwise. to some many of trump’s unique personality traits may make him seem “” but he’s the best person for the job in our rapidly changing world. in fact, there have been many candidates in the past who could have learned a thing or two from trump’s straightforward, unrehearsed approach. editor’s note: this is an excerpt from the new book “planes, steak  water: defending donald j. trump” by autry j. pruitt.',\n",
       " ' seven police officers to be charged in alleged underage prostitution\\xa0scheme   a san francisco bay area prosecutor will charge seven current and former police officers for their roles in an alleged underage prostitution scheme that has rocked the region’s law enforcement agencies. alameda county district attorney nancy o’malley announced friday that she plans to charge five members of the oakland police department, one member of the contra costa county sheriff’s office, and one member of the livermore police department. the charges range from engaging in prostitution, to lewdness, to obstruction of justice. three of the current and former officers face felonies. the case began last year when an oakland police officer killed himself and left behind a suicide note stating he had been involved with a teenage prostitute. the note also named several other officers who allegedly had contact with the girl, prompting a   investigation. the now    woman has said she had sex with more than a dozen officers in exchange for money and tips on when police planned to conduct prostitution raids. the scandal has prompted a cascade of resignations and firings. in june, three oakland police chiefs lost their jobs in one week. wednesday, four oakland police officers were fired, and thursday a livermore officer resigned. o’malley’s announcement friday states that she has also declined to charge other officers. she described the investigation as “labor intensive and extremely time consuming, and all necessary resources were expended. ” “we left no stone unturned in regards to the evidence. ” o’malley told reporters friday.

      "rape allegations, a breakout star, and the oscars: how the attempt to smooth nate parker’s past failed so badly  hollywood has given us many a master class in warped priorities, but film studio fox searchlight might have outdone them all, with one of the worst botched publicity campaigns maybe ever.    as it prepares for the october 7 release of its highly anticipated drama the birth of a nation, the studio has attempted to preemptively stave off awards season backlash by addressing   nate parker’s tumultuous past head on. but instead of bolstering the film’s oscar chances, it has created an extraordinarily ugly controversy, and everyone involved is worse off for it. this isn’t about a parking ticket pileup, or a troubled youth. it’s about parker and his birth of a nation   jean celestin being charged with rape 17 years ago, when they were wrestling teammates in college. (parker was acquitted and celestin was convicted, before the conviction was eventually overturned on appeal.) and it’s about hollywood spectators trying to reframe the fallout within the context of how many oscars it could cost the duo’s movie. ever since deadline published an exclusive interview with parker on august 12  —   under the headline ”fox searchlight, nate parker confront old sex case that could tarnish the birth of a nation”  —   the situation has only gotten messier and more tragic.    the men’s past rape charges should in no way be discussed in conjunction with how they might affect awards chances; that became all too clear on august 16, when variety revealed that the woman who accused parker and celestin died by suicide in 2012, at 30 years old.    on august 17, parker bypassed the press and released his own statement. but the damage is likely done  —   if it wasn’t already, years ago.   related allegations against nate parker have reinvigorated a push to understand sexual consent    now parker is at the center of exactly the kind of controversy he and fox searchlight were trying to avoid. but given the details of his and celestin’s 2001 trial, parker and fox searchlight’s terrifically insensitive attempts to weave them into a narrative about a movie’s oscar chances  —   not to mention the way our national conversation surrounding rape and sexual assault has changed since parker was tried  —   that’s hardly surprising.    parker and celestin were tried for sexual assault in 2001  —   and the fallout has lingered ever since as with most sexual assault cases, the details surrounding what happened are conflicting, confusing, and disturbing. but here are some facts, culled from documents and reporting on the october 2001 trial:  the    woman who accused parker and celestin  —   who requested anonymity, and has been most frequently identified as ”jane doe”  —   stated that she and parker were supposed to go on a date on august 20, 1999. when he was late, she ended up having several drinks with another unidentified man at the bar while she waited for parker to show up. she said she ended up blackout drunk (in addition to having taken a prozac, which she said she had been taking since 1997) in parker’s penn state apartment. she said she fell asleep, only to wake up once to parker ”having intercourse” with her, and then another time to celestin’s penis in her mouth.  parker and celestin insisted in statements  —   they did not testify during the trial  —  that she wasn’t blackout drunk but rather conscious and therefore aware of giving consent. both men remain committed to their statements today, 15 years after the original 2001 trial. jane doe recorded a phone call with parker two months after the night in question  —   without informing him it was being recorded  —   in which she told him her period was late. ”can you tell me honestly how many people i slept with that night, so i know what i’m looking at here?” she asked. parker confirmed himself and celestin, and maintained that he ”really didn’t know [she was] all that drunk.” significantly  —   a word i use because this detail was brought up both during and outside the trial  —   jane doe was white. both parker and celestin specifically discussed her race in their statements: celestin said that one of their wrestling coaches  —   kerry mccoy, whom they’d called for advice after realizing jane doe might be accusing them of rape  —   told him that ”being a black athlete, such allegations were not unusual.” according to parker, mccoy said ”these things come up with girls who feel guilty about what they did before, or may even find themselves pregnant with a multiracial child and rejected by her parents.”  parker was eventually acquitted of all charges, in part thanks to the jury concluding that jane doe was not unconscious. his verdict was likely also affected by the fact that parker and jane doe had engaged in a sexual encounter prior to the night of the alleged assault, as detailed in her testimony.  celestin  —   who did not have a previous relationship with jane doe, and who admitted to not wearing a condom when he had sex with her  —   was convicted for sexual assault. but the conviction was overturned in 2005 when he appealed to the pennsylvania superior court on the grounds that his defense attorney had been inadequate.  jane doe ended up dropping out of penn state. according to her brother  —   who spoke to variety about her suicide after more news outlets began reporting on the case in light of fox searchlight’s preemptive damage control  —   she was never the same after the trial. variety reported that her death certificate said she suffered from ”major depressive disorder with psychotic features, ptsd due to physical and sexual abuse, [and] polysubstance abuse.”  the charges never exactly faded from memory. they’re not only a matter of public record; they’ve also been on parker’s wikipedia page for years. and parker has never shied away from discussing the charges when asked about them. in fact, he’s been far more likely to bring them up himself, the better to get ahead of controversy before it has a chance to surprise him.             for example, in this   profile from 2007, the   wrote about parker’s upcoming denzel washington —  led film the great debaters with a section allocated to parker’s ”dark chapter.” parker’s mother was quoted as saying the alleged sexual assault was ”one of the most challenging moments of our lives,” and that she insisted in the aftermath that he ”turn to god” (which, according to the statements parker has released since then, he did).    ”if i had it my way, it would never be brought up again,” parker told the   at the time. ”it’s taken six years of my life to get past it.” but he probably knew even then that the case would haunt him forever. in january 2016, nine years after the great debaters was met with a largely positive response, parker took the birth of a nation to sundance. the film received rave reviews and won the festival’s top award, while also sparking renewed interest in the   ”dark chapter” of his life. but the studio that ended up with the movie  —   fox searchlight, which has distributed previous oscar nominees like little miss sunshine, beasts of the southern wild, and brooklyn  —   apparently was not aware of the controversy it might be taking on until it had already paid an unprecedented $17. 5 million for the rights to the film. fox searchlight and parker turned to deadline, which reframed his past within the context of how it could affect the film’s awards chances. that was a mistake. according to variety, fox searchlight only learned of the charges lurking in parker and celestin’s past after it made its   sundance purchase. but again, details of the case are so accessible that they appear on parker’s wikipedia page, so it was likely only a matter of time before the studio realized it could have a real problem on its hands. the studio has since released a statement saying it’s ”aware of the incident,” while noting that parker ”was found innocent and cleared of all charges.” the statement also emphasizes, ”we stand behind nate and are proud to help bring this important and powerful story to the screen.” to get ahead of possible  —   or, let’s be real, probable  —   controversy during awards season, parker and fox searchlight approached deadline, offering exclusive firsthand access to parker’s account of the story. this instinct makes sense; deadline is one of the most influential and   entertainment news sources in hollywood. if parker and his studio wanted to get their version of the story out there, the site was a solid bet.    but there’s no doubt that deadline writers michael cieply and mike fleming jr. should have cast a more discerning eye on the case and its circumstances. instead, they wrote more than 4, 000 astonishingly   words examining the birth of a nation’s future awards chances.             the piece is a   example of how not to approach sensitive, fraught topics like sexual assault. here’s how it set the scene for the   control to follow:  parker, with fox searchlight’s support, has decided to face this    legal matter, head on. hours before receiving the prestigious vanguard award from the sundance institute, parker invited a deadline reporter to his home thursday  —   remnants of the five daughters who live with him all around  —   to look him in the eye and discuss the case.  upon slicing into this layer cake of questionable editorial decisions, you can find the following:  praise for  ’s bravery alongside a dismissal of the allegations against parker as a ”   legal matter” a reminder that parker is on his way to being held in high esteem within the film industry, a reminder that parker is a father (of five daughters, no less!) shameless salivation from deadline over getting this exclusive  all told, the piece is an exorbitantly long dissection of parker’s feelings surrounding the case and his chances of establishing himself as a hollywood heavyweight with the stain of a rape charge lingering on his résumé. there’s probably a more sensitive version of the deadline article to be written, one that acknowledges that even though parker was acquitted, the facts of the case were complicated enough that his   celestin was convicted. but deadline clearly wasn’t interested in trying to provide an objective overview of the situation.    here are just a couple more   gems:    …     it is difficult at this point to weigh how history will impact parker’s historical biopic in the harsh light of the upcoming awards season, especially in a   cosby and roger ailes era when even an allegation of rape creates stigma, and where mel gibson was ostracized for merely saying objectionable things while drunk.  counterpoint: since when should ”awards season” be the primary concern when talking about sexual abuse allegations   hostile racism?  at trial, the woman testified she was intoxicated, unconscious through much of the encounter and upset to find she had experienced unwanted sex with parker  —   though she acknowledged having willingly engaged in oral sex with him during an encounter the day before.  counterpoint: first, ”experienced unwanted sex” is such a roundabout way to say ”raped” that it’s almost impressive. second, you can give someone a blow job one day and get raped by that person the next. the two incidents have nothing to do with each other, and implying otherwise is both wrongheaded and dangerous. there are plenty of similar examples in the full article. parker, for his part, emphasized throughout the interview that he has ”five daughters and a lovely wife,” as well as four younger sisters. also, his mother lives with him. parker told deadline that he’d fully expected the charges to crop back up as the birth of a nation neared release, but that he’s moved on ”from one of the most painful   …     [he wells up at the memory] moments in my life.”    but after variety broke the news on august 16 that parker’s accuser had killed herself in 2012  —   bringing considerably more negative attention to an already tense conversation  —   parker gave his own separate statement, which was notably more contrite than anything he’d said before. ”i see now that i may not have shown enough empathy even as i fought to clear my name,” he wrote on facebook. ”empathy for the young woman and empathy for the seriousness of the situation i put myself and others in.” this isn’t exactly the scenario searchlight and deadline wanted  —   nor probably anticipated   —   when they tried to get ahead of the bad press. but the whole mess shows just how gross it was to try to contextualize this kind of charge within the realm of a hollywood award. it also illustrates how drastically the national conversation surrounding rape and sexual assault has changed since parker was first charged. part of the problem with revisiting parker’s 2001 trial with 2016 eyes is that we’ve changed how we define and talk about rape it’s impossible to deny that rape trials were handled differently in 2001 than they are in 2016. in his closing statement at parker’s trial, parker’s attorney, joseph devecka, cited testimony from another penn state student who said jane doe was known to drink a few times a week before she was of legal drinking age. ”i ask you, ladies and gentlemen,” devecka said while addressing the jury, ”to use your common sense. how long had this been going on?” much of parker and celestin’s defense relied on their ability to prove not just that jane doe was more sober during the alleged assault than she claimed to be, but that she was a promiscuous woman prone to drinking heavily. it involved character witnesses against jane doe and in support of the promising wrestlers she had accused. it rested on parsing the differences between ”blacked out” and ”unconscious.”    these are all still depressingly common means of discrediting victims of sexual assault. it’s still alarmingly difficult to get courts, legislators, and civilians alike to grant the topic the balance of objectivity and sensitivity it requires. but the language surrounding how we talk about rape and sexual assault in america is undeniably and extremely different today from what it was in 2001. ”date rape”  —   the most commonly used term for rape by a person the victim knows, or is getting to know  —   wasn’t even coined as a term until the ’80s, as groundswell protests like take back the night and the idea that rape isn’t always a random act of violence gained prominence. perhaps most notable is that in 2014, the fbi changed its definition of rape from ”the carnal knowledge of a female forcibly and against her will” to ”[p]enetration, no matter how slight, of the vagina or anus with any body part or object, or oral penetration by a sex organ of another person, without the consent of the victim.” the social definition of rape has changed, too. as we reexamine cases that were first addressed or settled long in the past  —   whether it’s parker’s, roman polanski’s, bill cosby’s, or bill clinton’s  —   we’re inevitably going to be looking at them through a more unforgiving lens. reading the transcript of a 1999 phone call between parker and jane doe reveals red flags in 2016 that might not have registered so sharply in 2001. during that call, parker was insistent: ”i’m saying that you were completely conscious. you may not remember, you may say that you don’t remember   …     but you were awake, you know what i mean?” in 1999, that kind of difference led to his acquittal. in 2016, proving she was conscious might not have been enough.    like parker has said many times, the case was settled a long time ago. but his regret over the way he handled it then doesn’t change the fact that his continued insistence that his sexual contact with jane doe was mutually, enthusiastically consensual  —   even though almost all signs point to the contrary  —   is happening in 2016. the deadline article about parker’s dark past and the birth of a nation’s oscar chances was written in 2016. fox searchlight’s desperate attempts to change the narrative for its own gain are happening in 2016. all of them should know better. \n",

      " kalief browder’s family was about to settle his lawsuit — now everything is on hold  settlement proceedings between new york city and the family of a young man who killed himself after serving three brutal years in jail for a crime he wasn’t charged with have been placed on hold, buzzfeed news has learned. now, the brother of kalief browder is accusing city officials and the court system of “playing games” and delaying settlement proceedings in the family’s wrongful death lawsuit. “it’s been a long, drawn out process,” akeem browder told buzzfeed news. “we go back to court on march 21. judge is probably going to do what they’ve been doing  —   which is prolonging. it’s a game that they play. ” kalief was 16 when he was arrested in may 2010, accused of stealing a backpack in the bronx. with his family unable to make his $3, 000 bail, he was hauled off to rikers island, which has been an alleged hotbed of excessive violence against young men, and forced to stay there. akeem, 34, said finalizing the settlement in the $20 million wrongful death lawsuit ground to a halt after his and kalief’s mother, venida browder, died in october 2016. akeem says that his mother was ready to settle the case the next week. “she went into hospital on a thursday, friday she passed. that following thursday the lawsuit would have been settled,” akeem said. after venida browder died, her other children  —   akeem, his three brothers and one sister  —   took the case over. but that meant going through the process of moving the case to surrogacy court, assigning a new administrator for the case  —   a role which they all agreed his sister, nicole, would take on  —   plus, they had to hire new attorney. “we get an attorney, we go to court. a month later, the court says, there is a problem,” akeem says. venida browder’s estranged husband, who she kicked out of the house years earlier but never divorced, showed up to court, akeem says, claiming to have a stake in the settlement. “he comes to the court. court perceives him to be a husband. even though he hasn’t been around for years. turns into months of playing games,” akeem said. a spokesperson for the city’s law department said, “the court thought it prudent to put these proceedings on hold to allow time for the resolution of estate issues arising from the passing of ms. browder. the city stands ready to resume settlement discussions as soon as it is determined what parties would be entitled to share in the proceeds from a settlement. ” kalief spent over 1, 000 days at the prison  —   known for its brutal conditions for young men and women  —   and 800 of those days were in solitary confinement. he appeared in court over 30 times before his case was ultimately dismissed. his story became widely reported when on june 6, 2015, at age 22, kalief committed suicide, hanging himself with an air conditioning cord out the window of the family’s bronx home. the wrongful death lawsuit alleges that kalief was tortured and beaten during the three years he spent at rikers, leaving him unable to cope mentally even after he was finally released. “once a person commits a crime, and they know justly that they did the crime, they can come back from that,” former rikers corrections officer gary heyward told buzzfeed news. “in his situation he did nothing wrong, that’s a tougher situation to handle  —   i did nothing wrong, and i’m going through the same hostile lifestyle. ” heyward, who was fired from rikers for selling drugs, sneaking contraband into the jail, and pimping out female officers  —   crimes he served two years in prison for  —   appears along with other current and former rikers cos in a new documentary, time: the kalief browder story, which premieres on spike tv on march 1. “if you went through so much, only to find out that you’re not guilty, there’s no telling what’s going through his brain, how am i going to fit into society  —   he probably felt helpless,” heyward says. asked if he believes that any progress will be made at the family’s next court date on march 21, akeem says, “they’re just going to delay it again. ” “court has seen us four times, once a month,” akeem says. “they’re going back and forth and saying, we’re not ready. the court is not ready. the system plays games in anyway they can. when it comes to taking a life or taking someone off the street. justice doesn’t come for years. it’s a harsh game to play with human life. ”   \n",

      "The police cuffed Howard Bryant for allegedly assaulting his wife. Howard Bryant charged the police with racism. Police dropped their charges and Bryant dropped his. [But five years later the ESPN writer clearly hasn’t dropped it.  Bryant posits in the June 6 issue of ESPN the Magazine that “cops singing the national anthem” at sporting events stifles the expression of black athletes. “Nobody seems to care much about this authoritarian shift at the ballpark, yet the media and the public are quick to demand accountability from players they consider insufficiently activist,” Bryant writes. “They blame these black players for not speaking up on behalf of their communities, ignoring the smothering effect that staged patriotism and cops singing the national anthem in a time of Ferguson have on player expression. ” Surely the police from the mean streets of Shelburne Falls (pop. 1, 731) and Buckland (pop. 1, 902) stifled the expression of a black sports journalist, at least until he could straighten out the misunderstanding with the cops over why five witnesses at a Western Massachusetts pizza joint imagined seeing him assault his wife. Do they use LSD as a topping at pizza parlors in the Berkshires? Speaking of hippie hallucinogens, Bryant should have dined at Alice’s Restaurant (you can apparently get anything you want there) instead of Buckland Pizza. The irrational cops who took the word of five eyewitnesses over one NPR contributor make another   menace in the Berkshires, Officer Obie, look as terrifying as Barney Fife in comparison. Trooper Brian Doak merely heard five people say they saw Bryant strike his wife before slapping bracelets on Bryant. Officer Obie possessed a whole envelope, found at the bottom of a   pile of garbage, with Arlo Guthrie’s name on it to justify arresting him for littering. “Kid, I’m gonna put you in a cell. I want your wallet and your belt. ”I said, “Obie, I can understand your wantin’ my wallet, so I don’t have any money to spend in the cell, but what do you want my belt for? ”And he said, “Kid, we don’t want any hangin’s. ”I said, “Obie, did you think I was gonna hang myself for litterin’?” Howard Bryant views Officer Obie, Trooper Doak, and their brethren in blue in a more negative light than Arlo Guthrie did. At least that’s what his ESPN the Magazine article about a    push for patriotism at sporting events suggests. He believes the police presence nudges   athletes to become less of a presence in contentious public debates. LeBron James and his teammates when he played for the Miami Heat posed in hoodies in tribute to slain teen Trayvon Martin and Kobe Bryant donned an “I Can’t Breathe”   with most of his Los Angeles Lakers teammates to honor slain   salesman Eric Garner. But the   and   activism remains too tepid for Bryant, who blames sports franchises for conspicuously highlighting law enforcement and the military at their events. “Policing is clearly one of the most divisive issues in the country  —   except in the sports arena, where the    hero narrative has been so deeply embedded within its   fabric that policing is seen as clean, heroic, uncomplicated,” Bryant writes. “Following the marketing strategy of the military, police advocacy organizations have partnered with teams from all four major leagues to host ‘Law Enforcement Appreciation’ nights, or similar events. ” Policing, like the arrests police make, certainly divides. Cops and perps rarely see the events that bring them together through a lens that brings them together. Five years ago, at Buckland Pizza “several witnesses observed a black male striking and physically assaulting a white female,” according to a police report. But two days later, Bryant attorney Buz Eisenberg told Greenfield District Court, “This case is about the fact that racism still exists in America, and Howard Bryant is a victim of it. ” Howard Bryant probably doesn’t belong with the     and   known to inhabit Western Massachusetts jails. He doesn’t belong writing for ESPN the Magazine, either.\n",
      "     James Tracy, a professor who wrote that the mass killing of children at Sandy Hook Elementary School was an elaborate, staged hoax designed to pass   legislation, has been fired from his job at Florida Atlantic University. [University moves to fire professor who says Sandy Hook was a hoax] University officials began the termination process last month, after parents Lenny and Veronique Pozner wrote an opinion piece in the  : “It’s been three years since we last embraced our precious little boy, Noah. At    he was the youngest child murdered at the Sandy Hook Elementary School  …    . “  …     to our horror, we have found that there are some in this society who lack empathy for the suffering of others. Among them are the conspiracy theorists that deny our tragedy was real. They seek us out and accuse us of being government agents who are faking our grief and lying about our loss. ” They accused Tracy of badgering them for proof that the murders really happened. “Tracy even sent us a certified letter demanding proof that Noah once lived, that we were his parents, and that we were the rightful owner of his photographic image,” they wrote. “We found this so outrageous and unsettling that we filed a police report for harassment. Once Tracy realized we would not respond, he subjected us to ridicule and contempt on his blog, boasting to his readers that the ‘unfulfilled request’ was ‘noteworthy’ because we had used copyright claims to ‘thwart continued research of the Sandy Hook massacre event. ’” The letter, which called on the university to fire Tracy, sparked an outpouring of horror and outrage from people sympathetic to the families of victims. [False flags, true believers and trolls: Understanding conspiracy theories after tragedies] On Tuesday evening, university officials issued a written statement: “Florida Atlantic University today issued James Tracy with a Notice of Termination. This follows the Notice of  Proposed Discipline issued to James Tracy Dec. 16. “The effective date of the termination is Jan. 8, 2016. “James Tracy was scheduled to teach three classes during the upcoming Spring semester. Alternative instructors will be assigned to teach those classes. ” Tracy did not immediately respond to a message seeking comment.   people were shot and killed by a gunman in who then shot and killed himself in Newtown, Conn. a mass killing that shocked many Americans because most of those who died were young children. Tracy repeatedly questioned whether the shooting  —   and other recent mass shootings reported by the media  —   actually happened. [Remembering the victims in Newtown] A post apparently written by him on the “Hoax at Sandy Hook” Facebook page held that no one was killed at the school, that the  tragedy was faked, that “local  ” benefited financially by pretending to be grieving parents, and that the Pozners were trying to intimidate his employer into terminating him for researching and speaking the truth. [After Newtown shooting, parents enter the lonely quiet] Tracy “teaches courses examining the relationship between commercial and alternative news media and   issues and events,” according to Florida Atlantic’s website, with expertise in “media history and analysis, political economy of communication. ” In the letter from university officials, they noted that they had asked Tracy to report “outside activity” so that the university “can address potential, actual, or perceived conflicts of commitment or interest,” but that he had refused to do so.

      "In a searing, eloquent essay on living with schizophrenia, Deborah Danner agonized over the deaths of mentally ill people like her at the hands of police.  Less than five years later, she became part of that toll. A police sergeant, who was called because Danner was in distress, fatally shot her Tuesday in her Bronx apartment after she went at him with a baseball bat, police said. With the mayor saying the sergeant failed to follow his training in handling mentally ill people, Danner’s death seems to echo a scenario she dreaded in a 2012 essay.   “We are all aware of the all too frequent news stories about the mentally ill who come up against law enforcement instead of mental health professionals and end up dead,” she wrote. Danner called for “teaching law enforcement how to deal with the mentally ill in crisis” training the city has emphasized in the past two years.  Police have been looking into why Sgt Hugh Barry didn’t use a stun gun or call for specially trained emergency service officers. Bronx prosecutors announced Thursday they’ll investigate. Although investigators haven’t reached conclusions, Mayor Bill de Blasio branded the shooting “unacceptable” and said the situation didn’t appear to merit the use of deadly force, while sergeants’ union president Ed Mullins described the shooting as  . It wasn’t Danner’s first interaction with police, who had safely taken her to hospitals during previous psychiatric episodes, de Blasio said. Still, memories of lethal encounters between police and people in psychological crisis weighed on her. Her essay alludes to the case of Eleanor Bumpurs, a Bronx woman killed in 1984 after waving a knife at officers during an eviction. Danner saw the story as a stark example of insufficient police training. And, perhaps, it held a thread of personal connection: both black women were 66 and had histories of mental illness. For Danner, that illness was an   force of   depression, isolation and flashbacks to bad moments, she wrote in her essay, first reported by the New York Times. “I experience it as a need for constant vigilance” for any signal of a descent toward the behavior that spurred her to change clothes in a public restroom so an unspecified “they” couldn’t track her and to look for a public place to kill herself, she wrote. She said she had been sick since her late 20s and had been hospitalized several times. Relatives, she wrote, had kept their distance or acted maliciously. Her sister, however, was at her building to accompany her to a hospital when she was killed.  “My sister’s life was taken because she was ill,” Jennifer Danner said on Wednesday. US police departments have struggled with how to train officers on responding to emotionally disturbed people, said Chuck Wexler, who heads the   Police Executive Research Forum. In New York, a highly trained emergency service unit often responds, but the city has tried to give all patrol officers updated training on recognizing signs of mental illness and understanding how people in crisis might act and react to police.  “In these situations, slowing it down, using communication skills, using time and distance, is a very important factor,” Wexler said. City officials have said Barry recently took training and persuaded Danner to drop a pair of scissors before she tried to hit him with the bat. Danner gave her essay last year to attorney Charles J Hargreaves, who represented her in a case that gave her sister guardianship of her, he said. “She wanted to be seen as a whole person, not just a schizophrenic, not just a diagnosis. And she really was that whole person,” who loved books and enjoyed sketching people in a local park, he said Thursday. For all her struggles, Danner, who was appealing the guardianship ruling, wrote that she had found support through a church and from a therapist.  “I smile rarely,” Danner wrote, “but I am surviving. ” In the US, the National Suicide Prevention Hotline is    . In the UK, the Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123. In Australia, the crisis support service Lifeline is on 13 11 14.\n",
      "Rashaan Salaam, the former college football standout whose body was found in a Boulder, Colo. park earlier this month, died of a   gunshot wound to the head, according to the Boulder County Coroner’s office. Salaam won the 1994 Heisman Trophy  —   awarded to the best player in college football  —   after rushing for more than 2, 000 yards as a junior at the University of Colorado. He went on to play parts of four seasons in the NFL, winning the NFC Rookie of the Year award with the Chicago Bears in 1995. But his promising career was cut short, in part because of injuries. According to the Chicago Tribune, Salaam had    issues as well: ”Salaam was 20 when he was drafted and later admitted he wasn’t mature enough to handle everything that came his way. He was also open about his excessive marijuana use during his early days in the NFL. ” ’When I got hurt, I knew (marijuana) was a problem because it pretty much consumed all my time,’ Salaam told ESPN in 1999. ’I wasn’t going to practice or anything like that, so I pretty much spent a lot of my time sitting around and getting high, and that’s when I knew I had to let it go. I wasn’t outgoing. I was just to myself. All I wanted to do was go home and do what I wanted to do. I wasn’t a social person. I was an outcast.’ ” Salaam was    when his body was found on Dec. 5. The Boulder County Coroner’s office says it offered to test Salaam’s brain for chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or CTE, but his family denied consent, citing religious reasons. CTE has been linked to the deaths of several football players, including the suicide of Junior Seau, a Hall of Fame Linebacker who shot himself to death in 2012. CTE can cause, depression, impulsive behavior, suicidal tendencies, and emotional instability, among other symptoms, according to the Mayo Clinic, and has been linked to the repeated collisions sustained during long careers playing football. Even though Salaam’s brain wasn’t tested for CTE, his brother, Jabali Alaji told USA TODAY earlier this month that Salaam appeared to have CTE symptoms: ”Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) is the disease associated with concussions and can only be diagnosed after death under current science. Alaji indicated that Salaam’s brain was not donated for evaluation of CTE because of their Muslim faith and burial rituals, which call for burial within days after death and forbid desecration of the body. ” ’If Salaam’s brain were examined,’ Alaji said, ’I would guarantee they’d find it. I would guarantee it.’ ” In a recent profile piece, The New York Times reported that Salaam had moved near Boulder recently, home of the University of Colorado, and his greatest achievements on the football field. But a onetime teammate told the paper that Salaam increasingly kept to himself before taking his own life: ” ’Rashaan was 20 years old when he won the Heisman Trophy,’ [T. J.] Cunningham said. ’To achieve the epitome of success at 20, but then you can’t get to that point again  —   what did that do to Rashaan?’ ”That may be an insoluble question. For people who knew him, the prospect that he took his own life is hard to reconcile with someone best known for an infectious smile that brightened a room when he entered it.”\n"

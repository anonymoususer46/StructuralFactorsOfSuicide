      "['a suicide in texas there is a strange fiction that dominates american college campuses. it is the belief that america’s most “tolerant,” progressive, and sensitive communities are simultaneously virtual hellholes for marginalized members of the community, justifying emergency   measures designed to end oppression and defend the defenseless. thus, the federal government hypes false statistics that a staggering 20 percent of female students will be victims of sexual assault. thus, campuses implement disciplinary practices and policies that deny due process and treat straight men as guilty until proven innocent. and, colleges claim, it’s all necessary. after all, rape and sexual harassment represent   traumas. false accusations and unjust punishment? well, that’s just a momentary inconvenience  —   a small price to pay for the cause of social justice. \\ttell that to the family of thomas klocke, a student at the university of texas at arlington. \\tthe competing factual accounts are simple and difficult to resolve. a gay student accused klocke (who was straight) of typing “gays should die” into the search bar of his browser during a classroom conversation about privilege. when the gay student then typed into his own computer, “i’m gay. ” klocke then allegedly said that the gay student was a “faggot” and that he should consider killing himself. \\tklocke’s account was diametrically opposed. he claimed that the gay student called him “beautiful. ” klocke then typed into his web browser, “stop, i’m straight. ” the gay student replied, “i’m gay” and then allegedly kept glancing at klocke, who eventually got up and moved seats. \\tthe dean then allegedly assigned the case to the school’s associate director of academic integrity, who promptly issued an order prohibiting klocke not only from contacting his accuser, he also prohibited him from attending the class where the incident occurred, and  —   crucially  —   from contacting any member of the class, directly or through any other person. later, he reportedly barred klocke’s father, an attorney, from attending a meeting regarding the case, and then “decided” the dispute without following   procedures, without giving klocke the opportunity to contact or call witnesses, and indeed without hearing from any witness who could corroborate either student’s claims. the school, for its part, denies that it departed from mandatory processes and asserts that it “followed its policies and procedures. ” \\tthe associate director of academic integrity found klocke responsible for “harassment,” placed him on probation for the remainder of his academic career at the university, and prohibited him from returning to the class where the incident occurred, though he could work on “group projects outside the classroom. ” \\tparents of college boys sometimes take comfort that they can avoid the atmosphere of   hysteria by asking them to follow some relatively simple, commonsense guidelines. don’t drink too much. don’t engage the   culture. use basic manners so that coarse talk isn’t misconstrued. no advice is foolproof, of course, but following those three guidelines  —   in addition to being virtuous on their own merits  —   will help avoid a multitude of problems. \\tnot for klocke, however. if his account is true (the university claims it followed proper procedures) then he was doing everything right. he was minding his own business in class, declined an unwelcome sexual advance, and changed seats. if his account is true, a gay student potentially motivated by embarrassment or fear was able to take advantage of the known bias of campus administrators to punish the man that he approached. \\tthe lawsuit makes the interesting claim  —   one that rings true with my own experience  —   that universities have “sought prestige and publicity portraying themselves as leaders in curtailing sexual harassment, sexual violence, and aggressive behavior on campus. ” consequently, they “have a vested interest in enacting swift and harsh punishment (almost always upon males) who are merely accused of sexual harassment, sexual violence, or aggressive behavior, in order to preserve the appearance of their leadership. ” \\tduring my own legal career, i’ve worked with students who’ve experienced many of the same things that thomas klocke’s family claims that he experienced. i’ve represented students whose parents were barred from disciplinary meetings, leaving them to face the wrath of administrators alone. i’ve seen students exploit existing relationships with administrators to achieve favorable outcomes in campus controversies. and i’ve also seen the speed and authority with which universities will respond to complaints by members of favored progressive victim groups. \\tbut there’s something else i’ve seen. i’ve seen the cost imposed on students accused of misconduct  —   the fear and the stress as they feel like their reputations, their careers, and their dreams are vanishing before their very eyes. when they’re in the middle of the battle, and an entire school seems set against them, it can be hard to maintain perspective and to see through to the other side. \\tsuicide is a complicated phenomenon, and i have no doubt that additional facts will emerge as the case works its way through the judicial system, but no one  —   ever  —   should believe that crackdowns come without cost or that due process is an abstract concept, a mere inconvenience that stands in the way of social justice. as i’ve argued before, our universities stand on the edge of a constitutional crisis. lawsuits are filling courtrooms from coast to coast, men and women face terrifying   witch hunts, and the ideological and financial incentives are pushing universities to shove aside students’ and professors’ unalienable rights to meet the impossible demands of unreasonable campus radicals. \\tone doesn’t minimize sexual assault or sexual harassment by preserving due process. it is not a matter of either protecting the rights of the accuser or respecting the rights of the accused. instead, due process is a basic human right. failing to respect that right inflicts its own unique form of trauma on students, and sometimes that trauma can carry with it horrifying consequences.,', 'bullied 8-year-old’s death may not have been a\\xa0suicide the death was startling even to the coroner: a boy only    apparently killing himself in his cincinnati bedroom. now gabriel taye’s january death is being   after it emerged that he was   at school two days before he died. hamilton county coroner lakshmi sammarco’s office has ruled gabriel’s death a suicide, but she said last week that she was reopening the investigation to   the boy’s injuries and whether there were contributing factors to his death. “it was very hard for me to believe that an    would even know what it means to commit suicide,” sammarco said. suicides are rare among children so young, but not unheard of. statistics from the u. s. centers for disease control and prevention show an average of 14 suicides per year nationwide among children 10 or younger since 1999. that compares to over 1, 400 per year among   to   . at 8, children generally are just coming to understand death, says dr. louis kraus, chief of child psychiatry at rush university medical center in chicago. conceiving of ending their own lives can be even more remote. “it’s possible, but at this young age, it’s very uncommon,” kraus said. even if a child has an idea of suicide, “many kids this young really don’t conceptualize the permanency of what they’re doing and what could happen. ” experts stress that at any age, suicide is a complex decision that often reflects a combination of life events and psychiatric problems, whether diagnosed or not. warning signs can be harder to read in young children than older people, said dr. alec miller, chief of child and adolescent psychology at albert einstein college of medicine in new york. but while kids might not have the vocabulary to discuss depression, it still might show up, perhaps as a change in behavior or complaints about aches or fatigue with no physical explanation, kraus notes. gabriel had no history of mental health issues, said carla leader, a lawyer for his mother, cornelia reynolds. people who knew him describe him as a    kid  —   “a very loving little boy who always had a smile on his face and would bring a smile to your face,” said carolyn emery, whose children went to school with him. gabriel was at school jan. 24 when, as seen on a choppy surveillance video the cincinnati public schools system released friday, he apparently tried to shake hands with a boy who had hit another child. attorneys for gabriel’s mother said the boy pushed gabriel into a wall, knocking him unconscious. an assistant principal arrived about 4 ½ minutes later to look at him. the school system said that it was “concerned about the length of time that (the boy) lay motionless and the lack of adult supervision at the scene” but that administrators followed protocol by having the nurse evaluate him. school officials said the boy told staff he had fainted and never said he had been bullied or assaulted. they said school administrators asked reynolds to get gabriel and take him to a hospital. but her attorneys say she decided on her own to pick him up and take him to the hospital after her sister, who was babysitting while reynolds was at work, called to say that gabriel had vomited and was complaining of stomach pains. doctors concluded he likely had a stomach virus and sent him home. two days later, gabriel hanged himself in his bedroom with a necktie, authorities said. according to her attorneys, reynolds didn’t learn of the schoolhouse confrontation until her attorneys got a copy of a police investigative file that described the surveillance video.', 'parents of virginia teen who committed suicide sue school counselor  three weeks before    jay gallagher took his own life, a worried friend who lived in colorado sent an email to his school counselor at potomac falls high in potomac falls, va. telling the counselor that jay was saying things “with suicidal content,” according to a lawsuit filed in loudoun county circuit court on friday. “he’s usually crying alone in his room because he doesn’t seem to have a good relationship with his parents,” the girl wrote. the counselor, richard bader, met with gallagher, sending the girl a reassuring response: “talked with him today. thank you for bringing it to my attention. ” but should bader have notified gallagher’s parents? that question is at the center of a $5 million wrongful death lawsuit filed by jay’s parents, erin and timothy gallagher, against bader. the suit accuses the school counselor of negligence and ignoring school guidelines that direct counselors to notify parents if their children express suicidal thoughts. but julia judkins, bader’s attorney, said the suit does not tell the full story. judkins said that the teen told bader not to talk to his parents about their meeting and denied that he was suicidal. “they’ve left out the fact that this young man was 18 years old and he had the right to tell mr. bader, ‘please don’t tell my parents,’\\u200a” judkins said. robert hall, the attorney for the parents, said they had no idea their son was in trouble and believe they could have saved his life had they known he was suicidal. the parental notifications guidelines “need to be enforced,” hall said. “this was jay gallagher’s only opportunity to be saved. ” according to hall and to the lawsuit, jay gallagher was a stellar student and had been admitted to virginia tech. but unbeknownst to his parents, he put intense pressure on himself to perform well in school and was under extreme stress. jay’s father found his son dead in his room feb. 3. after his death, one of jay’s friends, a young woman who had moved to colorado from loudoun county, reached out to his parents to tell them that she had emailed jay’s school counselor to tell him of her concerns in the weeks before jay’s death. “last night was the most concerning due to the suicidal thoughts and the self harm,” the girl wrote in an email to the counselor in   adding that she did not believe his parents were “open to discussing issues or emotions. ” “i wanna say stress stems from busy schedule, lacking self worth and various expectations. ” bader met with gallagher, but never filled out the suicide screening form and never notified his parents. hall argues that the schools’ suicide prevention action plan required bader to follow those steps. judkins disagrees. “mr. bader didn’t do anything wrong,” judkins said, adding that their conversation did not meet the threshold for a suicide screening or parental notification. “it wasn’t applicable given the communications between mr. bader and young jay gallagher. ” the suit is a culmination of months of failed talks between school officials and the parents. hall said the parents sought to clarify the guidelines or policy that outline when a counselor should contact parents and to ensure that all counselors were aware and trained on the guidelines. the gallaghers wrote in a post on a facebook page they created in their son’s memory that they filed the lawsuit “with a great deal of reluctance” and merely hoped to push the school system to improve its procedures. hall said he asked school attorneys to meet for a confidential mediation session overseen by a retired judge and that the school system stonewalled the family and refused. but judkins said the mediation session stalled because the family asked the school board’s insurance company to be present and did not lay out their demands ahead of time.   get updates on your area delivered via email  ', 'at penn state, critics claim, there’s no handle on hazing  (cnn) from the outside, penn state’s fraternities are a captivating sight. regal   mansions line a street aptly nicknamed ”frat row,” just south of a picturesque campus nestled in a valley. but when the mansion doors open, the allure subsides. the crown molding and grand staircases can’t hide the wear and tear of nights of parties. a glossy coat of spilled beer, mud and sweat often overtake the character of that old hardwood floor. some who have pledged allegiance inside these walls have horror stories. two lawsuits against penn state allege that university officials failed to respond appropriately to persistent problems with hazing and alcohol use at its fraternities. the plaintiffs claimed pledges were forced to drink excessive and dangerous amounts of alcohol. one alleges fraternity brothers burned pledges with hot wax, held a gun to their heads, and forced them to kill animals. and that a penn state employee    a resident assistant    knew about it, but didn’t report it. in one case, a member of the fraternity documented the hazing and reported it to the school, but he says he was ignored. it wasn’t until february of this year, after    beta theta pi pledge timothy piazza died, that penn state halted pledging and enacted restrictions on alcohol consumption and social functions within its greek community. and after details of piazza’s death emerged on friday from a   indictment against 18 fraternity members    including eight on charges of involuntary manslaughter    a grand jury has indicated it will take a look at the bigger picture: was penn state complicit in enabling a culture where there was no accountability? the grand jury report said conduct in a ”permissive atmosphere fostered by the pennsylvania state university interfraternity council” led to piazza’s death. it goes on to say that the ”grand jury has chosen to develop a full report concerning the conduct of the pennsylvania state university interfraternity council and, perhaps, the conduct of the university itself.” penn state is just now exiting the tunnel of one of the darkest university scandals in history    the conviction of assistant football coach jerry sandusky for molesting young boys for decades, and three school officials for failing to report his crimes. the news hit the university hard, and critics accused school administrators of having a culture of silence. penn state, after former president graham spanier was convicted of one misdemeanor charge, endangering the welfare of a child, in the sandusky case, said, ”. .. while we cannot undo the past, we have rededicated ourselves and our university to act always with the highest integrity, in affirming the shared values of our community.” less than two months later, penn state faces more allegations that administrators failed to protect young people in their charge    this time, inside the walls of its fraternities. efforts to speak with officials about   and   problems have been declined, but penn state provided written responses, saying in part, ”numerous recent reports demonstrate that regardless of size or location, hazing, binge drinking and related sexual assault issues are occurring throughout the country.” penn state says it has strong misconduct policy, at a press conference friday, university president eric barron called the grand jury’s findings ”heartwrenching and incomprehensible.” he said penn state ”has one of the most aggressive student misconduct policies in the country and its   policy pertaining to misconduct remains the most vigorous in the big 10.” ”it should not go without saying that hazing and dangerous drinking are not permitted by the university and the university takes appropriate actions to education students about these issues and hold them accountable whenever it learns of such wrongdoing,” barron said. ”all indicators suggest that beta theta pi was a model fraternity,” he said. ”it is clear, however, that this was no model fraternity.” according to beta theta pi international fraternity, its penn state chapter was previously disciplined twice. the first time, in 2009, the chapter was suspended for a year after it was found to be serving alcohol to minors. when it came back, it was a dry house. but in 2013, it was found in violation of the   housing policy put in place by the national chapter. penn state told cnn that the university is aware of 170 chapter conduct cases since the spring of 2015. ”wherever appropriate the university separately pursues student misconduct proceedings involving individuals.” according to the   interfraternity conference, penn state has used a private security company to assist in monitoring fraternity social activities for the past several years.  ’drinking until you were vomiting’ two years ago, in march 2015, barron promised to take a hard look at greek life at penn state. it came after   james vivenzio described hazing he says he endured at kappa delta rho fraternity. ”drinking until you were vomiting, they were shoving alcohol down your throat all the time,” vivenzio told cnn. pledges would have to stand around a trash can, he alleged, drink until they vomited, and then pass the bottle. later, he said, they’d have ”to do     in your own vomit.”  vivenzio describes being forced, along with his pledge class, to gather ingredients for, and then drink, a mixture of ”the most disgusting things you can think of.”  ”urine, vomit, and kind of anything they could find. just smelling it would make you throw up. it was pretty bad,” he said.  vivenzio says he reported being hazed to penn state twice before going to the police and filling a civil lawsuit. first, he says, he tried to report it anonymously in the fall of 2013 while he was still a pledge through the hotline that penn state told freshmen about during their orientation. no changes were made, he said, so vivenzio began to document everything he could: alleged beatings, a private facebook page, the text messages to pledges that read, ”destroying ur lives, dignity and removing ur   souls.”  vivenzio says, after three months, he decided he could no longer take it. he left school, went back to his parents’ home in virginia and called penn state to report what he had documented. the director of the office of student conduct, danny shaha, drove from state college, penn state’s main campus, to the vivenzio home. with his parents, vivenzio sat at the kitchen table and handed shaha a stack of documents.  ”and we showed him all this and i pledged my help. i was like ’i want this to change,’” vivenzio said.  vivenzio says he heard nothing from penn state for a nearly a year.  in the meantime, because the fraternity hadn’t removed vivenzio from a private facebook group or the group text messages, vivenzio said he could see that hazing continued. vivenzio said it was not uncommon to see pledges talking about being ”forcefed liquor.” or messages like ”let’s haze.” it wasn’t until the student called police in 2015, and a private kappa delta rho facebook page made national news    because it contained pictures of seemingly unconscious naked women    that penn state investigated and found evidence of hazing, including underage drinking. police told cnn their investigation closed when, in may 2015, penn state banned the fraternity from its campus for three years and kappa delta rho expelled 38 of its members from the fraternity. penn state officials wouldn’t agree to an interview, but in a statement to cnn the university disputed vivenzio’s version of the story. penn state said it offered vivenzio ”extraordinary assistance ” but ultimately, ”neither he nor his family were willing to file a complaint, provide documentation, speak with state college police or participate in pursuing the formal disciplinary process.” vivenzio and both of his parents insist to cnn that they did everything they could to work with police and school authorities.  no consensus among task force members, after closing kappa delta rho’s chapter, barron announced the formation of a   task force, made up of community and university leaders. ”overall, we clearly knew that we could not . .. things could not stay the same,” said ron binder, associate dean of student affairs at the university of   who chaired one of the task force’s subcommittees and who used to be the national president for the association of   advisors. ”the committee worked pretty hard, close to a year and a half. i thought we came up with some good recommendations.” however, binder and another task force member, state college borough manager thomas fountaine, said there were a number of dissenting reports. at times, they said, there were strong and competing opinions that couldn’t be reconciled into a consensus. still, the subcommittees turned in their reports to penn state, but a final report was never made public. penn state says it felt that members of that task force couldn’t come to a consensus in areas that were ”critical to effect substantial change.” ”these issues are made more complicated by the fact that these organizations are largely   and operate independently. they are private organizations on private property. so meaningful change requires the   and deep involvement of the undergraduate active members,” a university spokesperson said. penn state enacted many of the task force’s recommendations after piazza died, according to binder. national greek group: ’we have known about concerns’ penn state has one of the largest greek communities in the nation. with 8, 000 students members of fraternity and sorority life, greek life is woven into the fabric of the nittany lion experience.  the universities largest    and most public    annual fundraiser, a dance marathon to raise money for its own cancer research fund, is largely propped up by greek life participants. but for two and a half years, penn state has not had a   director of greek life organizations, says jud horras, president of the   interfraternity conference.  ”in the absence of that, these alumni, students, university and national organizations, have a hard time working together,” says horras. penn state disputes this, saying ”the university has never been without a director of fraternity and sorority life,” adding that the danny shaha took over the interim position. horras has been critical of both the student leadership at penn state, and how the administration has dealt with student greek leaders. ”we have known about concerns and challenges there for quite some time. they’ve had alcohol concerns, hazing concerns, drug abuse. there have been a lot of concerns at penn state,” says horras, who is meeting with barron next month. ”the challenge is that the solution lies in getting the students to take ownership of the community and govern more effectively. they have to have ownership in the expectations set and their willingness to govern each other.” after piazza’s death, the university’s interfraternity council got into a open letter war with barron, exchanging blame for fraternity misconduct. horras said that, since then, he’s been encouraged by penn state student leaders who he says are ready to take on these problems, and said he sees ”signs that more collaboration between the administration, students, and alumni is starting to happen.” the circumstances of piazza’s death were shocking. he was allegedly forced to drink so much alcohol that his blood alcohol level was estimated to be about four times the legal limit in pennsylvania. the grand jury report says piazza was intoxicated when he fell down a flight of stairs, and that he proceeded to fall multiple times, repeatedly hitting his head, after fraternity brothers tried to revive him. the grand jury also found, as fellow brothers stepped over him, others googled remedies for his ”cold hands” and ”cold feet.” but no one called police for 12 hours. a grand jury on friday recommended 18 members of the fraternity be charged criminally    eight face involuntary manslaughter cases. the fraternity’s chapter president alone faces 200 counts related to hazing, aggravated assault, involuntary manslaughter and reckless endangerment.  ”the larger problem at penn state has been an institutional and culture void, and a culture of excessiveness and permissiveness to which penn state and any number of fraternities have turned a blind eye,” said piazza family attorney tom kline. ”. ..this death wasn’t an accident it was an inevitability based on everything that the grand jury said.” the governing body of beta theta pi international fraternity, where piazza pledged, issued a statement after charges against some of its members were announced. in part, it said, ”the early findings of that investigation indicated that the behavior of several undergraduate members was in direct contradiction of the international fraternity’s expectations and risk management policies, as well as the international fraternity’s reputation and commitment to character development. beta theta pi international fraternity has clearly and consistently expressed its position that it does not tolerate hazing or alcohol abuse in any form by its members. the former undergraduate members were well ecducated by the international fraternity and penn state on these policies however, they are entitled to the presumption of innocence as they face these charges.” cnn has been unable to reach beta theta pi’s local chapter president, or his lawyer, for comment.   one student jumped to his death, in the spring of 2014, about the same time that vivenzio officially reported hazing to penn state, another penn state family was dealing with a much more devastating tragedy. marquise braham, who was at penn state altoona on an academic scholarship, jumped from the roof of an   building on long island. it was the day before he was to return from spring break to his fraternity phi sigma kappa. braham had gone through brutal hazing during his fall semester as a pledge, according to his family’s lawsuit.  the suit, filed in december 2015, lays it out in detail: being forced to choose between snorting cocaine or being sodomized stealing gutting, skinning and killing animals forced physical fighting that resulted in concussions extreme sleep deprivation guns pointed at their heads hot wax dripped down their backs enormous consumption of alcohol. braham had befriended a fellow student, a female resident assistant who was supposed to be trained in recognizing and reporting school policy violations. in text messages made part of the lawsuit, she encouraged him to stick it out. ”i feel like i’ve done so much that it can’t get any worse but it always does lol,” braham wrote to her.  braham returned to penn state the next semester as a brother. the lawsuit claims he continued to struggle, forced to haze a new class of pledges. ”i’m just hanging in here haha. hazing season just started so i’m kinda glad to go back home. some of this shit is just hard to watch when you’re a brother,” he texted to her on march 5, 2014, according to the lawsuit. the next day, he continued, ”i just never thought i would get to the point where i needed counseling. that just isn’t me [you know] sometimes i just feel like i’m falling apart . ..” she responded: ”i am worried about you. i didn’t know it was this bad.” and later, ”i’m worried as f**k about you. ’” on march 7, 2014, the resident assistant and another penn state employee reported to their supervisor that they believed braham was in a state of dangerous psychological crisis, the lawsuit says.  ”but no action was taken to intervene, get marquise immediate help, or inform marquise’s parents of his psychological crisis, despite marquise having signed a waiver allowing penn state to communicate directly with his parents regarding his academic and health issues,” the family’s lawsuit says. the same day the resident assistant notified penn state officials of braham’s state of mind, braham, a devout catholic, returned home to uniondale and told his aunt that he needed to ”confess his fraternity ’sins,’” the lawsuit says.  he jumped to his death one week later. when his devastated parents asked penn state officials whether there were any warning signs    of why their seemingly happy and healthy son who was eager to help others and excited to pursue a career in physical therapy would kill himself at 18    penn state officials said nothing, the family attorney said.  ”penn state kept this information secret from the family, leaving them in the dark and exacerbating their suffering ever since his death,” the lawsuit says.  when the hazing became public, through a police investigation, penn state investigated, and revoked the phi sigma kappa’s license to operate on the campus for six years. phi sigma kappa members denied the hazing claims. in january 2016, the state attorney general’s office announced that a grand jury had investigated the case and returned no criminal charges. while the panel said there was evidence of   hazing that was ”extremely dangerous and put the health and safety of all pledges at risk,” it said there was nothing to connect braham’s suicide to his being hazed.   ”rather the evidence points to a young man who, though he had a sunny and very pleasant exterior, had been contemplating suicide for a very long time,” the grand jury said. ”(this) investigation and this report should shine a light on what can happen to vulnerable    when they go off to college.” penn state campus police say they will notify families of student emergencies, including times when they ”experience other personal emergencies.”     a penn state spokesman told cnn the university cannot comment on legal matters, but said the policy related to emergencies takes student privacy into account. ”we balance the critical   of the situation with the student’s privacy rights as we make the decision to contact parents, or not.” braham’s civil lawsuit is still being litigated and penn state has made a motion to have the case dismissed. penn state said that after his death, ”processes and practices for fraternity and sorority life on campuses were reviewed.” ’i saw something coming’  there is no national database of   deaths and incidents, so it’s hard to know how widespread the problems like those at penn state are.  horras, the   interfraternity conference president, said he is working with a new company to begin tracking fraternity misconduct across the country. federal privacy laws often get in the way of transparency, horras said.  vivenzio claims penn state’s representation of greek life is deceptive. he is suing the university for alleged fraud. the website says there are many myths about greek communities, but ”the reality is that men and women in fraternities and sororities are committed to their academics, volunteer their time in the community, develop and strengthen their leadership skills. ..” a qa on hazing says the school has a   policy.   ”those statements were knowingly false,” said vivenzio’s attorney, aaron freiwald. ”james and others relied on those statements to his detriment. penn state knew hazing was taking place and took a ’well, that’s what goes on here’ kind of attitude, so when they said there was zero tolerance for hazing, that was a false statement and (vivenzio) says he wouldn’t have rushed if he’d known about hazing.”  braham family attorney doug fierberg has sued over this issue in the past and won against several universities, forcing them to post all of their incidents online. other schools have followed voluntarily. penn state is not among them. penn state would not make any of its officials available for an interview with cnn, either before or after piazza’s death. it did respond in writing about the vivenzio and braham lawsuits, saying that ”after both instances of fraternity misconduct were reported to the university, penn state took the strongest action available. in addition to student misconduct proceedings, it withdrew recognition of the fraternities involved    which in essence shuts them down.” when vivenzio heard about piazza’s death, he said he broke down and cried.  ”i don’t understand why it was just kind of put to the side and not taken seriously,” he said. ”i saw something coming, and i really wish penn state would have listened. maybe it could have saved a life.”', 'video shows ’bullying’ incident days before 8-year-old took his life   (cnn) on mother’s day, cornelia reynolds will remember her ”only child, my best friend and my first true love.”   security footage shows her    son, gabriel taye, falling unconscious at a cincinnati school in an incident that may have led to the boy’s suicide two days later, an attorney for his family said. gabriel was found dead in january after he hanged himself with a necktie in his cincinnati home, according to the attorney.   after his death, a cincinnati police homicide detective reviewed security video from the boy’s school, carson elementary.  in an email, the detective told school administrators he noticed an incident in a school bathroom before the boy died. the detective said he saw ”bullying” and behavior that ”could even rise to the level of criminal assault,” according to a copy of an email obtained by cnn.  the cincinnati school district released the video friday after media reports of the detective’s email surfaced. school officials have said they decided to share the video with police even though the connection between the incident and the boy’s death remains unclear.   hamilton county coroner lakshmi sammarco announced thursday that she is reopening the investigation into the circumstances and contributing factors around the boy’s suicide in light of new evidence from the cincinnati police department. ”i know they had possession of evidence that we didn’t have. to us, there is new evidence, and we need to take a look at that,” sammarco told cnn, without elaborating on the nature of the new material. when sammarco first learned of taye’s death in january, she was shocked that an    would commit suicide. at first, she asked for his death to be investigated as a homicide, but the autopsy report ultimately concluded that taye died from asphyxiation and the manner of death was, in fact, suicide, according to sammarco.  ”it was very hard for me to believe that an    would even know what it means to commit suicide and so i asked cincinnati police to treat this as a homicide until proven otherwise and investigate it fully,” sammarco said in a radio interview with cnn affiliate  .  in a statement, the boy’s mother said, ”gabriel was a shining light to everyone who knew and loved him. we miss him desperately and suffer everyday. his life was not only stolen from him, but from those of us who expected to watch him grow up and enjoy life. if i could, i would give anything to have him back.”  what does the video show? in the    video, gabriel appears to be shaking hands with another boy in the entryway of a bathroom before he falls on the floor and lies motionless. children walk by the boy and over this legs. some seemingly inspect and poke him for about five minutes until an adult enters the bathroom. at least three adults enter the bathroom. they look at the boy, and some kneel down to get closer to him.  eventually, gabriel stands up and leaves with the adults. a case of bullying? the homicide detective inspected the security video as a part of the cincinnati police’s investigation into gabriel’s death. ”i wanted to bring to your attention some things i saw in the video. i saw some concerning events in the video and i don’t even have a child at the school,” the detective wrote in the email to school administrators. ”i witnessed behavior that in my belief is bullying and could even rise to the level of criminal assault but due to the apparent age of the children involved, my current opinion is it could be better dealt with appropriately at the school level.” no charges have been filed, officials said. the school district said it released the video reviewed by the detective in ”an effort to be completely transparent.”  conflicting accounts  jennifer branch, an attorney representing gabriel’s family, says she and reynolds were not aware of the incident in the bathroom until recently. they believe it could have led to the boy’s death. ”i am my son’s voice and it will be heard,” reynolds said in the statement.  ”as gabe’s mother, it is my obligation to make sure that this will never happen again.”  afterward, gabriel was taken to the nurse’s office, and his mom carried him to the hospital later that day when he began showing signs of nausea.   at that point, accounts begin to diverge. branch said the school told reynolds that her son had fainted. there was no mention of what happened in the bathroom, branch told cnn.  but school officials said in a statement a school nurse called reynolds to pick gabriel up from school and take him to the hospital. the school’s statement did not say what was wrong with the boy.  cincinnati public schools said its employees followed proper procedures. ”the school nurse checked gabriel’s vital signs, which were normal. she also contacted gabriel’s mother and asked her to pick him up and take him to the hospital to be checked out,” the district said in a statement. gabriel stayed home the day afterward and returned to school the following day. that afternoon, the boy’s mother found him dead in his bedroom. ”on mother’s day, please remember cornelia and gabe and give the people you love an extra hug in gabe’s memory,” branch said.

The counselor, Richard Bader, met with Jay Gallagher and received concerns about suicidal thoughts from a worried friend who lived in Colorado.\\n2. According to the lawsuit, Bader did not notify Jay's parents of the suicidal content despite being required to do so under the school's suicide prevention action plan.\\n3. The parents of Jay Gallagher, Erin and Timothy Gallagher, filed a 5 million wrongful death lawsuit against Bader, accusing him of negligence and ignoring school guidelines.\\n4. Julia Judkins, the attorney for Bader, argued that the suit does not tell the full story and that Jay had told Bader not to tell his parents about their meeting.\\n5. Robert Hall, the attorney for the parents, stated that they had no idea their son was in trouble and believe they could have saved his life if they had known he was suicidal.\\n6. The lawsuit highlights the importance of enforcing parental notifications guidelines to ensure the safety of students.\", ' Suicide is not mentioned directly in the text, but there are hints at it when it refers to \"heartwrenching and incomprehensible\" incidents. \\nHere are the sentences that talk about suicide or cause of suicide:\\n* The grand jury has indicated it will take a look at the bigger picture was penn state complicit in enabling a culture where there was no accountability...\\n* It goes on to say that the grand jury has chosen to develop a full report concerning the conduct of the pennsylvania state university interfraternity council and perhaps the conduct of the university itself.\\nThese sentences suggest that the grand jury is investigating whether Penn State\\'s culture of silence and lack of accountability contributed to Timothy Piazza\\'s death by suicide.\\n1. \"drinking until you were vomiting\" - This sentence is talking about hazing and alcohol abuse.\\n2. \"urgine vomit and kind of anything they could find\" - This sentence is also talking about hazing and the use of disgusting substances as part of the hazing ritual.\\n3. \"beatings a private facebook page\" - This sentence is indicating that there are reports of physical abuse within the fraternity.\\n4. \"documented everything he could alleged beatings a privatefacebook page\" - This sentence is talking about the efforts of one student to document evidence of hazing and abuse within the fraternity.\\n5. \"pledges would have to stand around a trash can he alleged drink until they vomited and then pass the bottle.\" - This sentence is also talking about hazing and the forced consumption of alcohol.\\n6. \"no changes were made\" - This sentence is indicating that the student who reported being hazed did not see any actions taken by the university to address the issue.\\n1. The university enacted many of the task force\\'s recommendations after Piazza died.\\n    2. Penn State has one of the largest Greek communities in the nation, with 8,000 students involved in fraternity and sorority life.\\n    3. Despite having a director of Greek life organizations, Penn State has faced challenges, including alcohol, hazing, drug abuse, and more.\\n    4. The circumstances surrounding Piazza\\'s death were shocking, with fraternity brothers forcing him to drink until he was unconscious, then falling down a flight of stairs and hitting his head multiple times.\\n    5. A grand jury recommended 18 members of the fraternity be charged criminally, including the chapter president, who faces 200 counts related to hazing, aggravated assault, involuntary manslaughter, and reckless endangerment.\\n    6. The Piazza family\\'s attorney, Tom Kline, stated that this death was not an accident but an inevitability based on Penn State and fraternities\\' culture of excessiveness and permissiveness.\\n Based on the provided text, the following are sentences that talk about suicide or the cause of suicide:\\n* \"One student jumped to his death in the spring of 2014 about the same time that Vivenzio officially reported hazing to Penn State.\"\\n* \"Marquise Braham, who was at Penn State Altoona on an academic scholarship, jumped from the roof of a building on Long Island. It was the day before he was to return from spring break to his fraternity, Phi Sigma Kappa. Braham had gone through brutal hazing during his fall semester as a pledge, according to his family\\'s lawsuit.\"\\n* \"The suit filed in December 2015 lays it out in detail, being forced to choose between snorting cocaine or being sodomized, stealing, gutting, skinning, and killing animals, forced physical fighting that resulted in concussions, extreme sleep deprivation, guns pointed at their heads, hot wax dripped down their backs, enormous consumption of alcohol.\"\\n* \"Braham returned to Penn State the next semester as a brother. The lawsuit claims he continued to struggle, forced to haze a new class of pledges. \\'I just never thought I would get to the point where I needed counseling,\\' he texted to her on March 5, 2014, according to the lawsuit.\"\\n* \"But no action was taken to intervene and get Braham immediate help or inform Braham\\'s parents of his psychological crisis, despite Braham having signed a waiver allowing Penn State to communicate directly with his parents regarding his academic and health issues, the family\\'s lawsuit says.\"\\n* \"When his devastated parents asked Penn State officials whether there were any warning signs of why their seemingly happy and healthy son who was eager to help others and excited to pursue a career in physical therapy would kill himself at 18, Penn State officials said nothing, the family attorney said.\"\\n* \"Penn State kept this information secret from the family, leaving them in the dark and exacerbating their suffering ever since his death, the lawsuit says.\"\\n1. The sentences talking about suicide are:\\n* \"the evidence points to a young man who though he had a sunny and very pleasant exterior had been contemplating suicide for a very long time\"\\n* \"after his death, processes and practices for fraternity and sorority life on campuses were reviewed\"\\nThese sentences suggest that the individual in question had been struggling with suicidal thoughts for a while before their death, and that the university investigated and made changes to its policies and practices after the incident.', ' Based on the text, here are the sentences talking about suicide or cause of suicide:\\n* \"Gabriel Taye fell unconscious at a Cincinnati school in an incident that may have led to his suicide two days later.\"\\n* \"His life was not only stolen from him but from those of us who expected to watch him grow up and enjoy life. If I could, I would give anything to have him back.\"\\n* \"The homicide detective inspected the security video as a part of the Cincinnati police\\'s investigation into Gabriel\\'s death.\"\\n* \"I witnessed behavior that in my belief is bullying and could even rise to the level of criminal assault, but due to the apparent age of the children involved, my current opinion is it could be better dealt with appropriately at the school level.\"\\n* \"School officials have said they decided to share the video with police even though the connection between the incident and the boy\\'s death remains unclear.\"\\n* \"The coroner announced Thursday that she was reopening the investigation into the circumstances and contributing factors around Gabriel\\'s suicide in light of new evidence from the Cincinnati Police Department.\"\\n1. At that point accounts begin to diverge.\\n     2. The schools statement did not say what was wrong with the boy.\\n     3. Cincinnati Public Schools said its employees followed proper procedures.\\n     4. She also contacted gabriels mother and asked her to pick him up and take him to the hospital to be checked out the district said in a statement.\\n    5.
